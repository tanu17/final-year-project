 At issue are hundreds of billions of dollars in loans that China extended to less developed nations in the past two decades, possibly more than the World Bank and other multilateral development banks combined, with little or no exposure to the kind of public scrutiny that Western governments, multilateral institutions and private banks generally accept when making loans.

 With their commodity exports plummeting amid the global economic crash, debtors to China in Africa and Asia may soon be faced with a horrible choice: Impoverish their people to pay debt service to China or default and forfeit key national assets, which they posted as collateral to Beijing. Many experts liken the situation to the “Third World” debt crisis that hammered the global south in the 1970s and 1980s.
 
 The world’s public and private sector institutions can only guess at the scope and consequences of this problem without clear information about who owes China how much and on what terms.

 The origins of China’s overseas lending spree lie in its need to find profitable uses for its vast reserves of dollar export earnings while also seeking to gain political influence in strategic, resource-rich regions of the world. Its centerpiece is President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative whereby Beijing has financed infrastructure projects in Laos, Pakistan and Nigeria, among other countries.

 In a sense, China’s conduct resembles past U.S.-led Western development-finance efforts — with one crucial exception. Generally, the West upheld a distinction between “soft” official lending, done under concessionary terms, and private bank lending, which included market interest rates and collateral.
 
 China, however, uses state banks to lend to governments, or, often, government corporations, at market rates. Hungry for cash and — until now — confident they could pay China back through future growth, African and Asian nations took the deal. Corrupt officials may have regarded China’s secretive ways — including nondisclosure clauses in loan agreements — as an added attraction. Fraud and waste plague many Chinese-backed projects.
 
 AD
 
 Yet because of its hybrid official-commercial character, Chinese state-bank lending falls outside the purview of two key international monitors: the Paris Club for government-to-government credits and the Institute for International Finance for private-bank-to-government funding.

 Harvard economist Carmen Reinhart and two colleagues, Sebastian Horn and Christoph Trebesch, from Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy, spent two years scrubbing previously untapped data sources and found that China had loaned $400 billion to 106 developing and emerging-market countries through 2017 — half of which does not show up in debt-burden data from multilateral organizations and credit-rating agencies.
 
 Fifty developing countries owe at least 15 percent of their respective GDPs to Chinese state banks, the study found; 12 of these owed more than 20 percent.

 Zambia may soon have to forfeit collateral — its third-largest copper mine — in return for debt relief from China, according to the Wall Street Journal. There is precedent: In 2018, Sri Lanka had to give China a 99-year lease on a port because it couldn’t pay the construction loan.
 
 AD
 
 Western governments and financial journalists have been calling attention to this ticking bomb for years, urging China to join the Paris Club and assume the transparency obligations that go with it. China has insisted instead on dealing with its debtors one-on-one.
 
 China modified that stand slightly amid the coronavirus crisis by agreeing to the Group of 20 governments’ very limited moratorium on debt service for the world’s 76 poorest countries through the end of 2020.
 
 AD
 
 With so much obscurity surrounding what nations actually owe China, there is a real risk to the United States and Western creditors, public and private, that cash debt relief they provide poor countries will end up funneled to Beijing’s banks. And broader restructuring would still require major changes in Beijing’s policies.
 
 There can be no effective and coordinated international response to the financial crisis facing the whole world, especially its poorest nations, unless and until China agrees to come completely clean about its overseas lending.
 
 AD
 
 Having failed to meet its global public health responsibilities, Beijing must not be allowed to get away with nondisclosure and self-centeredness in global finance.

If discussed at all, these migrant workers are generally demonized as the infantry “invading” the host country and “stealing” local jobs. In reality, they are extremely vulnerable to exploitation by their employers, sometimes even more so than their local co-workers.
 
 AD

 The International Labor Organization reports that there are 14.2 million people in forced-labor situations worldwide and that indebted migrant workers are particularly vulnerable. Overseas Chinese workers are no exception.
 
 The recent federal criminal conviction of a Chinese construction firm executive for subjecting workers in New York to forced labor is a case in point. According to trial testimony, prior to leaving China, the workers signed contracts promising to not interact with locals, to not leave their residence without permission and to return to China after completing their multi-year assignment — at which point the bulk of their salary would be paid. Each worker was required to post a security deposit of more than $20,000 to guarantee his compliance. Once in New York, workers’ passports were seized and they were required to work long hours and live in unsafe conditions. Fear of losing their security deposit and not collecting their earned wages essentially handcuffed them from escaping this exploitation.
 
 This case is not unique. Official statistics reported there were nearly 1 million overseas Chinese workers in 2018 (excluding the large number of undocumented Chinese migrants), and researchers studying Chinese projects in places such as Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Pacific Islands have found abhorrent labor conditions for foreign workers.

 Incurring significant debts to pay large recruitment fees based on inaccurate job information is quite common. Federal authorities found that each of 2,400 migrant workers hired by Chinese firms to build a casino in Saipan, part of the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, paid recruiters, on average, $6,000 in fees, and that they were cheated out of millions of dollars in wages.
 
 In Belarus, hundreds of Chinese workers were unpaid for three months after working “like slaves.” Chinese companies failed to pay proper wages, provide protective equipment and conduct safety training in the Bahamas, Ethiopia and Vietnam, respectively. A Chinese construction worker in Israel recently died on the job. And, for those employees working for smaller Chinese subcontractors, labor conditions can be even worse.
 
 Deep in debt, without passports, and lacking access to transportation and independent advice, Chinese workers are often left to endure these conditions without recourse. Those lacking proper visas are subject to quick deportation and are thus even more vulnerable. Language barriers make effective complaining to the host government difficult, and the Chinese embassy or consulate may be hours away. Those workers who are courageous enough to protest their maltreatment have been beaten by their employers or arrested and deported by local authorities.

 So why should China care? Aside from a duty to protect its citizens, these conditions frustrate China’s broader objectives for the Belt and Road Initiative, such as building “win-win” projects, “people-to-people” connections and soft power. If Chinese executives are eventually jailed and projects stalled, companies and lenders will lose money. Employing flocks of often illegal Chinese migrants housed in Chinese enclaves fuels resentment amongst locals, while subjecting its citizens to abusive and unsafe work conditions inevitably hurts China’s image. Rampant immigration and labor violations have already caused officials in some jurisdictions to question lax visa policies that previously welcomed Chinese.
 
 To its credit, China has acknowledged these problems, issuing policies and regulations that prohibit the collection of recruitment fees or security deposits, ban the hiring of workers on tourist visas and instruct companies to safeguard labor rights. But policies and regulatory standards are usually vague and not legally binding, and the legal provisions in place are routinely violated.
 
 China should announce plans to address this issue at this month’s forum. The policies governing overseas conduct by Chinese firms — particularly those regulating subcontracting — should be translated into detailed, binding domestic laws with real penalties that are rigorously enforced. China’s banks should require projects they fund to adhere to and report on fair labor standards and practices. Complaint mechanisms must be established, and workers taught how to access them. Chinese embassies and consulates should assist in monitoring labor conditions. And China should demonstrate its commitment to labor rights by finally ratifying the International Labor Organization’s conventions on forced labor.

 If China hopes to persuade host countries that it respects the rights and interests of their citizens, the best place to start is by showing how seriously it takes the welfare of its own.","['initiative', 'forgotten', 'projects', 'policies', 'chinese', 'belt', 'chinas', 'conditions', 'overseas', 'workers', 'labor', 'china', 'security', 'victims', 'road', 'vulnerable']","{'Bahamas': 1, 'Belarus': 1, 'China': 10, 'Ethiopia': 1, 'Israel': 1, 'Northern Mariana Islands': 1}",,,,,

 This question is being asked around Asia and other parts of the world after the rollout of China’s Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. Once likened to the Marshall Plan that revived Europe’s struggling economies after World War II, the trillion-dollar program to fund and build ports, railroads, power plants, dams and pipelines in some 70 countries is now being framed by critics as not exactly an imitation of American largesse but more as an example of debt-trap diplomacy in which China angles to gain influence overseas by bankrupting its partners and bending them to its will.
 
 Albeit slowly, poorer countries are awakening to the downside of Chinese cash. Montenegro took Chinese money, labor, construction material and engineering to build a highway from its port on the Adriatic Sea toward Serbia. But now with the highway less than halfway built, the tiny Balkan nation faces the prospect of incurring debt of more than 80 percent of its gross domestic product. The International Monetary Fund says Montenegro can’t afford to finish the project.
 
 Sri Lanka was so indebted to China after approving a string of ambitious projects that it was forced last year to lease a port in Hambantota to a Chinese company for 99 years. American and Japanese concerns that China planned to use the port as a naval outpost have caused them to increase their military assistance to the island nation. On Wednesday, Sri Lanka’s defense minister announced that it would not allow China to use the port for military purposes — at least a temporary setback for Beijing.

 Pakistan is facing a full-blown debt crisis, partially due to years of incompetent and corrupt political leadership but also thanks to its unquenchable thirst for the Chinese yuan. In Pakistan, the Belt and Road Initiative goes by another name, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. To date, some $27 billion in projects are being built as part of what is envisioned to be a $62 billion plan to resuscitate Pakistan’s sputtering economy. But, as with Montenegro, the IMF has warned Pakistan that it can’t afford to repay its Chinese debts — at least $10 billion and counting.
 
 Now Pakistan’s new government is considering asking the IMF for a bailout. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for one, was not amused, telling CNBC in a late July interview that “there’s no rationale for IMF tax dollars, and associated with that American dollars … to go to bail out Chinese bondholders or China itself.” Befitting its role as Pakistan’s “all-weather” friend, China coughed up $2 billion more to Pakistan last month, just days after Pakistan’s new prime minister, cricket legend and international playboy Imran Khan, won an election.
 
 In addition to Malaysia, several countries have stopped or scaled-back Chinese projects. Myanmar is trying to renegotiate a $10 billion port project; Nepal wants to halt construction on two Chinese-built hydroelectric dams. Other nations are so in hock to China that they say little, but things there have already approached a point where analysts believe that debt crises are almost inevitable.

 A Chinese-built railway through Laos is worth half of that little nation’s GDP. In a report by two researchers from Harvard’s Kennedy School, former Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans is quoted as saying Laos and Cambodia, each of which has borrowed more than $5 billion, are now “wholly owned subsidiaries of China.”
 
 In Malaysia, the specific trigger to Mahathir’s concerns are a group of Chinese development projects that were approved by his predecessor, Najib Razak. Najib was voted out of office this year and is now facing corruption charges. Investigators in Malaysia are looking into whether people close to Najib brokered the deals with China so that they could use Chinese funds to, among other things, bankroll Najib’s reelection campaign. This would seem to violate a key section of Chinese Communist catechism: the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Number three on that list vows “mutual noninterference in each other’s internal affairs.”
 
 The irony doesn’t stop there. Number one on that list is: “Mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.” And yet, in both Malaysia and Pakistan, Chinese firms want to build Chinese-only gated communities, an unintended throwback to the bad old days of international settlements in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Tianjin when Westerners lorded it over the Chinese.

 At the tip of the Malaysian peninsula, Forest City is a metropolis being built on four artificial islands. It has space enough for 700,000 people. Marketed at prices too high for the average Malaysian, the development is targeted at mainland Chinese. It was even designed by a Chinese company. But that, too, risks a backlash and has raised fears in Malaysia about upsetting the delicate ethnic balance between Malays, Indians and Chinese.
 
 Pakistan, too, is reportedly to be the site of a Chinese-only community, this one for 500,000, near the port of Gwadar, which China is building as part of its “string of pearls” project to construct ports, possibly for the use of its navy, across the Indian Ocean to Africa. In addition, Chinese companies in Pakistan, worried about terrorism and kidnapping, employ thousands of Chinese security forces who appear to act outside of Pakistani law. If this isn’t extraterritoriality, it isn’t clear what is.
 
 The Chinese have called their system “socialism with Chinese characteristics.” Perhaps “imperialism with Chinese characteristics” makes more sense.

 But not everyone is convinced that Belt and Road is such a great plan — either for China or the countries in which it’s investing. And with Malaysia announcing Tuesday that it has shelved two major infrastructure projects being built by Chinese companies because of high costs, many more leaders around the world may be wondering whether Chinese investment is a good deal.
 
 It may be simpler to start with a more basic question: What is the Belt and Road? Given the vague way that Beijing has described the program, it’s hard to find an answer. Many have found it easier to think of the initiative in terms of its scale and ambition: Beijing has called it the “project of the century,” while others have compared it to the Marshall Plan, Washington’s stimulus package for a war-ravaged Europe (though the Belt and Road is many times bigger).
 
 It’s not a single thing, but rather a catchall term for investments in more than 60 countries around the world. The purported aim of that network is to better connect China with its trading partners. In practice, it usually involves getting foreign countries to take out large loans from China to build vast infrastructure projects, which are then typically built by Chinese companies.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 All of that is quite obviously in China’s interests. In the short term, it’s able to use some of its excess industrial capacity abroad as its own economy slows. In the longer term, it could help internationalize Chinese companies and give Beijing a critical role in how global trade operates.
 
 There’s also a powerful political motive: A Pentagon report released last week said China was trying to “develop strong economic ties with other countries, shape their interests to align with China’s, and deter confrontation or criticism of China’s approach to sensitive issues.”
 
 Even so, many foreign partners were eager to sign up for the Belt and Road — largely because the loans tend to come with far fewer restrictions than those from Western countries.
 
 AD
 
 But Malaysia’s decision shows how the plan can come apart. For one thing, Belt and Road projects have sometimes made no economic sense. In Sri Lanka, China poured money into an airport designed to handle 1 million passengers a year. Now it has been dubbed the world’s emptiest international airport. “Business is so slow that the airport has made more money from renting out the unused cargo terminals for rice storage than from flight-related activities,” wrote Bangkok-based writer Brook Larmer.
 
 AD
 
 Another Belt and Road project in Sri Lanka, a deepwater port, is now in the hands of a state-owned Chinese company on a 99-year lease after it failed to attract enough business to make its loan payments. This could swell into a bigger problem: A study released by the Center for Global Development in March suggested that Djibouti, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Maldives, Mongolia, Montenegro, Pakistan and Tajikistan would also struggle to repay Chinese Belt and Road loans.
 
 To critics, this is a feature of China’s plan, not a bug. China, they say, is planning to bully smaller countries with “debt diplomacy” — and some even go further, suggesting that perhaps the plan is for China’s military to make use of all these belts and roads one day in the future. (It should be noted, however, that debt-fueled projects that make no commercial sense can be carried out within China, as well.)

 What’s certainly clear is that the ambiguity of the Belt and Road is a major concern for its current and prospective participants. Beijing doesn’t release a central list of projects or the funding they’ve been given, and key parts of the process — such as bidding on contracts — are generally kept opaque. In Malaysia, where the deals were cut under former prime minister Najib Razak, officials now say they were made to bail out a Malaysian state investment fund plagued by graft. Najib left office in May and was arrested in July on corruption-related charges.
 
 AD
 
 The Belt and Road still has its admirers. Experts have pointed toward some projects, such as an oil pipeline in Myanmar and rail networks in Kenya, that seem to be worthy capital investments. And countries will certainly come knocking on Beijing’s door as long as there’s easy money to be had. Turkey, in the middle of an economic downturn and a dispute with Washington, may be next.
 
 But Malaysia’s high-profile decision to back out of projects shows how quickly the tide can turn against China’s vision. Indeed, to many, Beijing’s dream of a new future is starting to look uncomfortably like nightmares of the past. “We do not want a situation where there is a new version of colonialism happening because poor countries are unable to compete with rich countries,” Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said at a Monday news conference in Beijing.
 
 AD
 
 The discontent may come from within China, too. A string of defaults on Belt and Road loans could cause Beijing fiscal problems, and risky loans to foreign countries are now a tougher sell for President Xi Jinping as the domestic economy faces its own issues. If a serious downturn hits while China is showering cash on projects abroad, Bloomberg News’s Shuli Ren warns, “you can expect a revolt.”

 The “Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road” (a.k.a. “One Belt, One Road,” a.k.a. “The Belt and Road Initiative”) is an infrastructure and development plan pitched more than three years ago by Xi. (Strangely, the “road” is a sea route and the “belt” is on land.)
 
 The plan was initially modeled on the ancient Silk Road, the network of trading routes spanning from China to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. China has now pledged to spend hundreds of billions of dollars building ports, railways, airports and power plants not just across the Eurasian landmass, but in nearly every corner of the world.
 
 Reaction has been mixed. The United States, India and others have voiced concern about the Belt and Road's geostrategic implications. Others have wondered about the social and environmental impact of Beijing’s vision.

 The Chinese government has been trying hard to head off these questions. For years now the Chinese Communist Party’s propagandists have been running “New Silk Road” advertorials in foreign media outlets. The sustained sales pitch, combined with the promise of cash, also has legions of foreign think tanks, institutes, banks, magazines and newspapers issuing reports.
 
 It's not that the initiative isn't big — it is. McKinsey noted that if all the “Belt and Road""-pledged money is spent it would dwarf the U.S.-led Marshall Plan that helped western Europe rebuild after World War II.
 
 Quantifying “how big” is difficult because the scope is always changing, said Michael Kovrig, the International Crisis Group's senior adviser for Northeast Asia. The Belt and Road initiative has become “an umbrella for many of the projects and investments under the latest phase of China’s “going out” policy of encouraging Chinese enterprises to pursue opportunities abroad, and an extension of the Western Development, or “Open up the West” (Xibu dakaifa) strategy.”

 “China is putting a lot of capital and institutional effort behind the Belt and Road. But it’s not going to reshape Asia in a few years. It will take a couple of decades to assess the impact, if China sticks with it,” he said.
 
 The focus on the big-ness of it all often obscures questions about if, when and how all of this building will take place, as well as questions about the impact of the plan. Meanwhile, state-approved talking points about the “Belt and Road” are seeping into coverage, particularly as the international press seeks to turn Xi Jinping into President Donald Trump's foil.
 
 With Trump promoting an “America First” foreign policy, China wants to be seen as the global player. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this year, Xi, the authoritarian leader of a one-party state, positioned himself as a champion of free trade. Despite compelling evidence that his government protects Chinese companies from foreign competition, he was praised for a “robust defense of globalisation.”

(Thomas Peter/Reuters)
 
 When President Trump withdrew from the ­Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in January, critics said he was leaving a vacuum at the heart of the Asia-Pacific region, ceding the United States’ role as regional economic leader.
 
 On Sunday, China plans to show how it is filling that vacuum.
 
 At a major set-piece event in Beijing, President Xi Jinping will pro­ject himself as the leader of a new economic order, and extol an ambitious global trade and infrastructure development plan known as the Belt and Road Initiative.
 
 Some 28 leaders from Asia, ­Europe, Africa and Latin America — including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte — are scheduled to attend the two-day summit.
 
 They will be hoping to land a share of hundreds of billions of dollars in promised Chinese lending and investment dedicated to the building of ports and railways, power plants and pipelines across the globe.

 The plan, launched by Xi four years ago on a visit to Kazakhstan, initially was modeled on the ancient Silk Road, a network of trading routes that spread from China across Asia to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Today, the initiative’s scope has grown to cover almost the entire world — although not the United States.
 
 Xi announced Sunday’s Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation during a well-publicized speech in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which he cast China as a champion of globalization and himself as a guardian of the liberal economic order.
 
 So far, the Belt and Road plan is more rhetoric than reality, experts say, more a repackaging of existing projects than new money on the table. Still, the message is coming through loud and clear, and Xi’s flagship foreign policy venture — which he also is using to consolidate his strongman image at home ahead of a key Communist Party congress in the fall — cannot be written off.
 
 “This is another chance for Xi Jinping to strut his stuff on the global stage and burnish his leadership credentials,” said Tom Miller, author of “China’s Asian Dream: Empire Building Along the New Silk Road.” But, he added, it also relates to Trump. “Withdrawing from the TPP left a void at the heart of economic leadership in Asia, and Xi Jinping is trying to jump into that void,” Miller said, referring to the Pacific trade deal.
 
 China’s state media have lauded the plan as “globalization 2.0,” a new model for the world economy driven from the East rather than the West, but also an exemplar of “win-win” cooperation.
 
 Yet there is no doubt that Xi is at the helm, and the plan has generated suspicion as well as enthusiasm outside China.
 
 India is unhappy that one of the flagship projects is a $50 billion economic corridor to the Arabian Sea traversing the territory of its archrival, Pakistan, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will stay away Sunday.

 The leaders of Germany, France and Britain will not be there either, mainly because of domestic elections, but also because Europe’s core nations are wary of any attempt by Beijing to undermine regional unity by showering poorer European countries with cash. The leaders are also unhappy that China is not doing more to open up its own markets and encourage foreign investment.
 
 Putin is equally wary of China’s influence in Central Asia, a region that Russia considers its back yard, and is embracing the Chinese plan with “gritted teeth,” said S. Frederick Starr, chairman of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute and Silk Road Studies Program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington.
 
 China’s motives for the plan are primarily economic, as it looks for new drivers for growth and seeks markets abroad to counter a slowdown at home. Construction projects may help relieve overcapacity in industries such as steel and cement, while China’s underdeveloped and troubled west could — in theory, at least — benefit economically from closer links with the rest of Asia.
 
 The plan also offers the country’s vast state-owned enterprises a global testing ground, according to Jan Gaspers at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, based in Berlin.
 
 There is a security dimension, too — an attempt to stabilize China’s “near abroad” with economic opportunity, potentially countering the spread of radical Islamist ideas in Central Asia.
 
 But it also is impossible not to see the project through a geopolitical lens, a “Chinese effort to build a sphere of influence,” said Paul Haenle of the Beijing-based Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy.
 
 Smaller nations that become dependent on Chinese money may feel obliged to support China’s stance on international issues. In addition, the infrastructure being built, such as ports, could have a dual use, one day helping China to project its military power.
 
 But will any of it work?
 
 “I am a bit skeptical,” said Matthew P. Goodman, who has been tracking efforts to reconnect Asia at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Not only does China have many challenges of its own, he said, but “the infrastructure business is very difficult: everything from geography to land rights, from political, social and environmental issues to making it a viable investment proposition.”
 
 Commerce Ministry data shows that foreign direct investment from China to countries identified as part of the Belt and Road Initiative fell 2 percent in 2016 and has fallen an additional 18 percent in 2017. Overall, outbound investment to 53 Belt and Road countries reached $14.5 billion last year, less than 9 percent of the global total.
 
 And when projects have started, not all has been smooth sailing. That’s partly because Chinese firms have a habit of striking deals with countries’ political elites and being insensitive to ordinary people’s concerns — a blind spot perhaps developed in an authoritarian state.
 
 [Chinese companies face culture shock in countries that aren’t like China]
 
 Protests broke out in January over a Chinese-built port and industrial park in Sri Lanka. There also have been concerns in the past about dams in Burma (also known as Myanmar) and Cambodia, as well as fears about potential Chinese immigration and land grabs in Central Asia.
 
 Railway projects connecting Thailand and Laos and in Indonesia have run into delays and disagreements over costs, while a flagship project in Europe — a railway to connect Budapest and Belgrade, Serbia — is under investigation by the European Commission over possible breaches of public procurement rules.
 
 But China is learning from some of its missteps, experts say, with its new Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank hiring Western experts, studying global best practices and pledging to be “lean, clean and green.”
 
 It is also infinitely more committed to its Belt and Road project than the United States was to a New Silk Road plan launched by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2011 to revitalize Afghanistan as the link between Central and South Asia.
 
 Clinton’s idea never really got off the ground, and the Obama administration was criticized by experts for responding negatively to China’s new bank. The Trump administration is sending a delegation to the Belt and Road Forum led by Matthew Pottinger, special assistant to the president and National Security Council senior director for East Asia. But it may also need a long-term regional plan of its own.
 
 “This is a major challenge to the United States,” Goodman said. “If not through the TPP, we need to reengage, to figure out another way to play in the Asia-Pacific arena. There is so much at stake for us economically and politically. We don’t have an economic strategy, and we need one.”

Citizens from Nigeria, Eritrea, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan can no longer apply for visas to work and live in the United States; Sudan and Tanzania will no longer be able to participate in the diversity visa lottery, which gives green cards to 50,000 immigrants from underrepresented countries randomly each year.

 This new ban is likely to strain ties with these countries, including some that already cooperate with the United States and others that Washington has been courting. It is also a diplomatic windfall for China.
 
 All of the countries mentioned in the expansion have deepened economic ties and cooperation with Beijing in recent years. And while the United States retains some goodwill in most of them, this new ban will further diminish the image of the United States in these countries, pushing them further into Beijing’s sphere of influence and further from democracy.
 
 Chinese interest in the targeted countries has been clear for years. Five of the countries are part of China’s ambitious $1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative. The sixth, Eritrea, has in the past year gone on record supporting the project — an unsurprising position given that China is Eritrea’s “largest investor, creditor and trading partner.”

 China has made Nigeria one of its largest investment partners in Africa, investing $5 billion there in 2015 alone. Chinese investment in Tanzania exceeds $7 billion. China wrote off $10 billion of Sudan’s debt in 2018, also investing the “largest share” of $60 billion in African aid there. China owns nearly half of Kyrgyzstan’s $3.8 billion foreign debt. American firms, on the other hand, often shy away from these markets, citing lacking institutions.
 
 Chinese influence in Myanmar has waxed and waned, but the Myanmar government is facing international isolation for its military’s violent expulsion of 700,000 Rohingya Muslims. This makes it once again reliant on Beijing. Chinese leader Xi Jinping recently visited Myanmar and signed dozens of deals with its leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who said: “It goes without saying that a neighboring country has no other choice, but to stand together till the end of the world.”
 
 Some of these countries have also provided cover for China internationally over its abuses of more than a million Muslims in Xinjiang. All but Kyrgyzstan and Tanzania signed a July letter defending what Beijing calls “vocation education and training centers” — what most everyone else recognizes to be detention camps.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 This has all given the United States some diplomatic space — space that the Trump administration is now squandering.
 
 Under Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the United States sidelined human rights in favor of U.S. interests, allowing Washington to pursue ties with unsavory regimes such as those in Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Although this was a deeply imperfect policy, current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has unwisely swung American strategy to the other side of the spectrum.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 In the context of Pompeo’s sanction-laden, “all sticks and no carrots approach,” the expanded travel ban further isolates the United States and drives home the narrative that, under Trump, it has been untrustworthy and unpredictable. China, on the other hand, still offers simpler, “no strings attached” partnerships and could use this opportunity to bring these countries deeper into its fold.
 
 Washington needs to develop a principled foreign policy that combines pressure on human rights, which can sometimes imply sanctions, with continued and patient engagement. The travel ban expansion, however, is anything but patient. Instead, the administration’s rash focus on immigration restrictions has delivered a self-inflicted diplomatic blow — and an unexpected win for China.

The belt and its equivalent “road” — new maritime routes — form the basic design of BRI.
 
 China’s plans may backfire as local resentment festers
 
 Central Asia is also a crucial juncture in China’s national security strategy. Prominent scholars like Wang Jisi at Peking University argue that China must “march west” and pay attention to this region to maintain stability in its restive frontier regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. Collectively, Kazakhstan and neighboring Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan share a 2,050-mile border with Xinjiang.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 But are Beijing’s actions alienating these vital security partners? Analysts note an uptick in anti-Chinese sentiment in Central Asia after Xi called for a “great wall of iron” in 2017 to protect against unrest in Xinjiang — a key gateway to BRI projects. Beijing’s clampdown has spiraled into religious repression and internment camps detaining up to 2 million Muslims in Xinjiang, including ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz.
 
 Anti-Chinese sentiments are on the rise in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The Kazakh government has sought to stifle news of the camps from spreading by arresting prominent activists and “anti-China protesters.""
 
 There’s been similar activism in Kyrgyzstan, where social media accounts link opposition to Chinese development projects in the country with concerns about the abuse of China’s Muslim population. The Kyrgyz government has fined some of these activists, and publicly denied any human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 Kazakh students in Beijing, however, have described a climate of fear following the arrests of Kazakh citizens in Xinjiang. Several students told me that they deliberately avoid layovers in Urumqi, Xinjiang’s capital, out of fear of Chinese detention.
 
 Border tensions may flare anew
 
 As China grows more powerful, some analysts are concerned that Beijing will revisit unpopular border agreements with Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. According to Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Regional Development, in 2014, 32 Chinese citizens rented some 4,750 hectares — just 0.0002 percent of the national acreage. But local concerns over land rights flared in 2016 when the government proposed amendments to the land law to allow foreigners to rent agricultural plots for up to 25 years. Following protests, the Kazakh government shelved the amendment.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 The memory of territorial concessions is a painful one for these nations. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Central Asian republics inherited unresolved border disputes with China over more than 900,000 square kilometers. During the 1990s, Kazakhstan and China reached agreements over 2,420 square kilometers. Although the Kazakh government claimed it “did not gain or lose anything,” critics of the Kazakh government countered that the deal gave away territory that had been Kazakhstan’s land in the first place.
 
 In 2011, Tajikistan ratified a 1999 deal to cede 1,122 square kilometers in the Pamir Mountains to China, ending a 130-year dispute. Days later, the government of Tajikistan announced plans to bring in 1,500 Chinese farmers to cultivate rice on 2,000 hectares — significant acreage in a country where only 6 percent of the land is arable. The government negotiated behind closed doors to avoid the experience of Kyrgyzstan, which saw parliamentary opposition and a spate of protests after the 1999 agreement with China.
 
 There’s a wariness in Central Asia about Chinese workers
 
 In Kyrgyzstan, conflict between Kyrgyz and Chinese workers is commonplace. In August, 500 Kyrgyz villagers entered the site of a mine operated by a Chinese company and fought with its Han workers — hospitalizing 20 of them. Chinese companies are now working to counter negative perceptions.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 Other sources of conflict are frequent claims that Chinese workers are marrying Kyrgyz women in large numbers, even though only 60 such marriages were recorded from 2010 to 2018.
 
 Many critics of China in the region also fear an influx of Chinese immigrants, although the actual numbers seem low. From 1995 to 2014, around 93,000 people emigrated from China as part of an official Kazakhstan repatriation program. Only 80 of them were Han Chinese, China’s majority ethnic group, representing 92 percent of the overall population in China.
 
 Chinese investments lack transparency — and this fuels local distrust
 
 Of the 68 countries involved in the BRI, 23 have a high-risk debt ratio, including Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Beijing accounts for around half of Kyrgyzstan’s $4 billion in foreign debt — a heavy load given that country’s annual GDP of $7 billion. Unlike Kazakhstan, which can sustain its high debts with revenue generated from its energy sector, resource-poor Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan appear at greater risk of default.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 How Central Asia spends this money also comes under scrutiny. In Tajikistan, much of the money borrowed from China has gone toward building basic infrastructure such as roads and tunnels — but a new, $230 million parliament building appears simply to benefit local elites. To pay off $300 million in debt, Tajikistan has already given China ownership over a lucrative gold mine. Almost half of Tajikistan’s $2.9 billion external debt — around $1.38 billion — is owed to China.
 
 Kyrgyzstan’s leaders awarded a $386 million contract to a Chinese company in 2013, prompting a corruption scandal that led to the arrest of two former prime ministers. Protesters in Kyrgyzstan have demanded more scrutiny over Chinese-funded enterprises and the appropriateness of loans. However, it remains to be seen whether local authorities will suppress these protests, or seek new ways to reduce the dependence on China.
 
 For now, Central Asian governments seem to be keeping local anti-China sentiments in check. But local pushback may well remain a threat to China’s economic agenda and in the long run, and could undermine Beijing’s security interests.

What are the local impacts?,"But what are the economic benefits — and costs — for host countries? As the BRI enters its fifth year of implementation, questions are swirling about whether these infrastructure investments provide good value for money.
 
 Critics of the BRI claim that the vast global network of new road, rail and pipeline projects will benefit primarily China. Securing sea lanes, ports and refueling stations will help China’s exporters reach overseas markets and give China uninterrupted access to energy imports. Establishing overland connections to the Indian Ocean will open new trade routes and make Chinese military and commercial vessels less vulnerable to strategic choke points such as the straits of Malacca and Hormuz.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 But will BRI also benefit the people living in host countries?
 
 In his keynote address at the 2017 Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, Chinese President Xi Jinping indicated that the central objective of BRI is to build “land, maritime, air and cyberspace connectivity” and create “networks of highways, railways and sea ports.”
 
 We recently provided evidence that many of these types of Chinese development projects accelerate economic growth in host countries. But it is unclear who benefits the most from such projects. By building connective infrastructure that helps local residents and businesses reach more distant markets, these investments could spread economic activity to rural, remote and disadvantaged areas. However, if ruling elites in host countries are able to control these projects and steer them to politically privileged areas, it is also possible that Chinese investments could widen preexisting economic disparities.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 In a new AidData working paper, we put these competing arguments to the test. We start by pinpointing the locations of 3,485 Chinese government-financed projects implemented in 138 countries around the world from 2000 to 2014. Our data set mostly captures projects that predate the BRI (see map), but it is global in scope and includes many of the same types of infrastructure projects that are now being financed under the auspices of the BRI.
 
 We then use an innovative measure of local economic output — satellite data on nighttime light — to construct a measure of inequality that can be tracked from year to year in more than 32,000 subnational localities around the world.
 
 To isolate the impact of Chinese government-financed projects, we employ statistical analysis to account for other factors that could have affected levels of economic inequality between 2000 and 2014. For more details on the methodology, see here.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 Chinese-financed connective infrastructure reduces inequality
 
 There’s some good news to report. Chinese development projects — in particular, investments in connective infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, railways and ports — create a more equal distribution of economic activity within the provinces and districts where they are implemented. We also estimate the impact of these investments on inequalities between subnational jurisdictions and find that Chinese projects narrow rather than widen economic disparities.
 
 AD
 
 Many countries that stand to benefit from BRI investment also suffer from high levels of inequality, making them vulnerable to these knock-on effects. Therefore, to the extent that China can help these countries increase economic activity in rural areas that have traditionally suffered from neglect or discrimination, U.S. and other Western powers may see a diminished need to engage in costly and complex humanitarian, peacekeeping and state-building activities in distant lands.
 
 AD
 
 The conventional wisdom among Western pundits and politicians is that Beijing is a reckless, self-serving or sinister actor creating problems that others eventually will have to fix. But our findings suggest that, in at least one important respect, the opposite is true: By narrowing spatial inequalities within countries, Beijing’s investments address one of the root causes of instability around the globe and potentially reduce the number of global threats and crises that Western powers need to tackle.
 
 China’s motivations and impacts are more complex than they seem
 
 AD
 
 At the same time, it would be a mistake to think that Chinese development finance is always compatible with the interests and objectives of Western powers. Beijing uses its aid to influence the way that countries vote in the U.N. General Assembly, which could weaken Western influence in international decision-making. Chinese development projects also can fuel local corruption, degrade the environment, weaken trade union participation and saddle host governments with unsustainable debt burdens.
 
 AD
 
 This complex portrait of China’s motivations and impacts is difficult to reconcile with the simple narrative about the BRI that has taken hold in Western capitals. Those who make and shape policy in the United States and Europe have quickly coalesced around the notion that BRI is a thinly veiled attempt to position China at the center of the global trading network; a charm offensive to buy the allegiance of world leaders; and a strategic bid to challenge U.S. hegemony in Asia and the wider world.
 
 All of these claims deserve careful empirical scrutiny. But if BRI projects play out the way that Chinese development projects have in the past, we will probably learn that this simple narrative belies a more complex reality — especially after accounting for the economic benefits and costs that accrue to host countries.

They’re wrong. Here’s why.,"U.S. and European policymakers have seized on this narrative. For instance, during a July 2015 trip to Africa, President Obama mentioned that China has “been able to funnel an awful lot of money into Africa, basically in exchange for raw materials that are being extracted from Africa.” He sought to differentiate the United States from China, noting that “economic relationships can’t simply be about building countries’ infrastructure with foreign labor or extracting Africa’s natural resources.”
 
 But is this narrative true?
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 In a new AidData working paper entitled “Apples and Dragon Fruits: The Determinants of Aid and Other Forms of State Financing from China to Africa,” we argue against it. It’s true that China and other governments provide many different types of state financing to African nations. But only those flows that the OECD considers to be official development assistance (ODA) should be considered “aid” in a strict sense. That may seem to be a fine distinction — but it matters.
 
 We propose that China has very different motivations for providing its various sources of financial support to other countries. We test our hypothesis using AidData’s open source database of Chinese development funding across Africa (see figure below) between 2000 and 2013.
 
 There’s a difference between aid and financing.
 
 AD
 
 Our paper punctures several of the most popular and persistent claims about Chinese development finance.
 
 AD
 
 Take for example the claim that Chinese “aid” is funneled primarily to corrupt and authoritarian regimes and motivated by China’s insatiable appetite for natural resources. We find no evidence that China favors authoritarian or corrupt regimes (so-called “rogue states”) when it allocates official development assistance (ODA). Nor does China seem to take natural resource considerations into account when committing ODA to African states.
 
 Instead, we find that Chinese ODA to Africa is strongly oriented toward poorer countries. Beijing seems to consider demand-side humanitarian and socioeconomic needs when making ODA allocation decisions. We also find evidence that China rewards foreign policy support from its aid recipients. These findings, when taken together, suggest that Chinese ODA is allocated much as is that from Western donors.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 By contrast, more commercially-oriented forms of Chinese state financing, with higher interest rates and lower grant elements (known in the trade as “other official flows,” or OOF) tend to go to countries rich in natural resources and with higher levels of corruption.
 
 That’s why pundits and policymakers believe that Chinese “aid” flows to rogue states that are resource-rich. Chinese ODA doesn’t disproportionately flow to such countries. What does are other forms of state financing, not “aid” in the traditional sense.
 
 Previous empirical research (discussed at The Monkey Cage and elsewhere) had suggested that the “rogue donor” narrative was overblown. But the difficulty in distinguishing between ODA and OOF made it hard to debunk fully.
 
 AD
 
 Okay, but who cares which is an investment and which is philanthropy?
 
 AD
 
 Our findings have important implications for those who wish to improve the effectiveness of aid. Given that China’s aid-giving has a reasonably strong philanthropic element and the impact of aid depends in part on a donor’s motive for providing it, there are some grounds for optimism about China’s ability to improve economic and social outcomes in the developing world.
 
 But this is not the only reason Western powers should welcome rather than fear more aid from Beijing. As Western donors and China realize that their similarities are greater than their differences, they may find it easier to work toward a common aim: limiting the negative consequences of fragmented and un-coordinated aid.
 
 AD
 
 So which nation delivers more aid to Africa: the United States or China?
 
 Another popular claim is the notion that China now provides as much, or more, aid to Africa than the United States. Again, it’s not so. China committed approximately $31.5 billion of ODA to Africa between 2000 and 2013, or approximately $2.25 billion per year, according to our analysis of AidData’s Chinese Official Finance to Africa dataset.
 
 AD
 
 By comparison, the United States committed nearly three times as much ODA to Africa over the same period of time: $92.7 billion from 2000 to 2013, or approximately $6.62 billion per year (see the figure below).
 
 When we broaden the analysis beyond ODA to include “other official financing” (OOF), we find that China and the United States provide comparable levels of funding to Africa. We estimate that China and the United States committed $94.3 billion and $107.9 billion of total official financing to Africa, respectively, between 2000 and 2013.
 
 Why has it taken so long to establish these facts? One reason: China’s government discloses few details about its overseas development efforts. Another is that researchers have developed idiosyncratic measurement standards for defining and counting Chinese “aid” that make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons with Western development finance. A lack of transparency in the data and the methods that researchers use to draw conclusions has also created confusion rather than clarity.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 Our findings help explain why pundits and policymakers continue to mischaracterize the intent and nature of Chinese development finance. We hope that by entering a new source of evidence into the public record, apples will be compared to apples, and dragon fruits will be compared to dragon fruits, so that Chinese development finance is evaluated on its merits rather than the ideological commitments, political interests, or biased samples used by the various critics and defenders of Beijing’s activities in Africa.

 Should the West fear China’s growing influence on the African continent? While there is no question that China and Chinese companies are changing the way African politicians seek aid and investment, the relationship between the two sides is far more complicated than simple narratives about “democracy or dictatorship” or “trade not aid” suggest. Veteran journalist Howard W. French explores this complexity in his book, “China’s Second Continent: How a Million Migrants are Building a New Empire in Africa.” He graciously took the time to answer my questions about the book and China’s role in Africa.
 
 LS: Much of the discourse in American politics is that the U.S. should be afraid of China’s role in Africa because China is undemocratic or “trying to take over.” Is this a fair approach? Why or why not?
 
 HF: I’m afraid the American discourse on China and Africa is very confused and generally not very insightful. Part of that is driven by the recent, still startled realization in this society of just how serious a competitor China is becoming, and part of that reflects the baggage of very old and nearly immutable American attitudes toward Africa, which are bound up in paternalism and in using Africa as a kind of vanity mirror to help us brighten our own self-image and feel better about ourselves.
 
 Make no mistake, China is competing with the United States, and an important element of that is going where its major rival, namely us, is thinly represented on the ground, lightly engaged in terms of political, economic and policymaking resources — in other words, places where the United States has been coasting or has simply not brought its “A Game.” This background has a lot to do with why China has made such a big and concerted push into Africa in the last 10 to 15 years, and why, not coincidentally, the United States didn’t really sit up and pay attention until fairly recently. Even with that, we are stuck with old policy paradigms in Africa that hark back to the Clinton administration, of favoring selected autocrats who can keep order locally in their regions, cooperate with the United States in its extra-African policy priorities, especially those related to radical Islam and the “war on terror,” and we do so, furthermore, in the naive conviction that the autocrats also offer a better chance at generating and sustaining economic growth. This is how, for example, Barack Obama came to announce Ethiopia as the political highlight of his coming, near-end-of-presidency visit to the continent, and adding a visit by the leader of democratic Nigeria, an immensely important country, only as an apparent afterthought and in response to a certain outcry.
 
 In the final analysis, though, the reason to pay attention to Africa is not China. We need to get over the idea that one needs an excuse to pay attention to Africa. That, too, is a holdover from the Clinton era, when they came up with out-migration and the threat of epidemic diseases as an excuse to have a look in on the continent, perhaps as a response to Robert Kaplan. The best reasons to pay attention to Africa are inherent to Africa itself. They go to extraordinary demographics, with an upside at least as full of opportunity as the downside is full of risk. They go to the immense opportunity for both Africans and Americans represented by economic growth on the continent, which needs to be enhanced and broadened. They go to urbanization. And, finally, they go to matters of universal interest related to the environment, in other words, helping ensure that Africa, which is a late-starter in many economic processes, can both maximize its potential and get things right environmentally. As long as we cast our interest in Africa in negative frames, of security, or rivalry with China, we’ll continue to miss this hugely important big picture. Similarly, as long as we continue to play small ball, politically, calling an Africa policy the occasional gathering of “young entrepreneurs,” hosting four or five African leaders together at once for a photo op at the White House, and making a mere one or two visits to the continent at the presidential level per term, we’ll be failing to engage the continent’s potential and simply missing out.
 
 LS: Most of what we are used to seeing in reporting on China’s involvement on the African continent focuses on Chinese state-owned enterprises and large corporations engaged in massive infrastructure projects. You cover these, but the picture you paint in “China’s Second Continent” is far more nuanced than the usual narrative, with much of the discussion focused on individual Chinese who moved to the continent to farm or engage in petty trading in places like Mozambique or Senegal. Other than a shared nationality, it’s not clear that the ordinary Chinese who are permanently migrating to Africa have a lot in common with the multinational corporation executives working there. Does it make sense to focus on “China in Africa” as a theme, or should social scientists be analyzing it as many phenomena?
 
 HF: There is no question that one must try to disaggregate more when dealing with this topic. One of my starting goals in undertaking this project was simply trying to unravel the mystery of how so many Chinese ended up in Africa in such a relatively short period of time. I learned very quickly that almost none of this could be explained in authoritarian, command economy terms, where the state, at some central level, drew up a master plan that said “By year X, we need to have a million Chinese in Africa,” and set about rounding them up for resettlement here and there. The working title I proposed for my book, in fact, was “Haphazard Empire,” and that is because I quickly learned that for all of the planning and ambition of the Chinese state, lots of things quickly began to unfold in these relationships that had little or nothing to do with any set scheme or blueprint. Personally, one of the richest veins in my reporting was to discover how vigorously Chinese from different parts of that country compete with each other and regard each other with suspicion, stereotypes and resentment, and beyond that I was surprised to learn just how common it is for Chinese on the ground in Africa to look askance at their own state.
 
 LS: You discuss many of the complaints I’ve also heard from African friends about China’s activities in their countries, issues like low wages, environmental devastation and supporting corrupt leaders, as well as overt racism. Should ordinary Africans be concerned about China’s growing influence in their countries?
 
 HF: There are several cases of small or low-density countries, where the numbers of Chinese have ballooned suddenly, where Chinese influence on the ground has grown very quickly, and where it is not too soon to begin thinking about the risk of state capture. Namibia, which I explore in the book, comes to mind. In general, though, I feel a fair amount of optimism on this topic. What I learned is that African civil societies are pretty robust and sophisticated, and they are not about to roll over for anyone. This has presented the Chinese newcomers with a steep learning curve in many places, because they disembark with certain feelings of superiority, whether economic or cultural, and discover that in many ways, the Africans are more politically sophisticated than they are.
 
 LS: Is China’s influence bad for Africans who want their countries to be more democratic? Is the “China is propping up dictators” narrative we often see in the Western media fair?
 
 HF: China, unsurprisingly, is looking out for China, seeking opportunity wherever it can find it. That said, Beijing is wary about a risk to its image of getting too comfortably and blatantly in bed with the most egregious despots on the continent. I think that Guinea under Dadis Camara was a big lesson for China, which was sorely tempted to float his regime as a way of wedging itself into the game for its immense natural resources, only to see him ejected from power. It has also been interesting to watch the growing caution China has shown with Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe. At a certain point, making friends with leaders means making enemies of the people, and China has gradually become a more astute reader of that balance. Of course, it is on Africans to get their houses in order, politically, and to send the right kinds of signals to outsiders, from whatever quarter, about the kinds of relationships that can be tolerated.
 
 LS: “China’s Second Continent” is a very personal, reflective work framed by your many years working as a journalist in China and all over the African continent. Did you draw on any academic research when researching and writing the book? Who’s getting it mostly right in terms of analysis, and which approaches are misguided?
 
 HF: I have a great deal of respect for academics. This stems, in part, from a transformative discovery I made as an Africa correspondent early in the Internet age, when I stumbled upon discussion groups like H(umanities)-Africa, which I began to follow avidly and learn so much from. I continued this practice as I moved from one region of the world to another, to the point where I now follow academic discussions pretty much every day on three or four different parts of the world. It takes a lot of time and can leave your head swimming, but this has come to constitute a really important part of how I engage with the world intellectually.
 
 For this book, of course I read the literature. However, this project could be said to be a response at some level to what I found most lacking in the academic takes on the subject. When I set out, far too much of the literature was written at the 30,000-foot level, with big-picture analyses and lots of abstraction. For my taste, far too many people were setting out from a seemingly pre-fixed perspective ideologically, often poorly acknowledged, of whether China was good or bad for Africa, which struck me as sterile and unsatisfying. To begin with, the world doesn’t usually work in such stark binaries as this. My biggest dissatisfaction, though, was that there were so few voices of what we call “real people” in my business. Shockingly few Africans of any description could be heard from discussing how they lived and experienced this new reality, of a burgeoning Chinese presence and engagement with the continent. Chinese voices were scarce, too, except for officials and people from semiofficial think tanks and universities in China, who tended to speak in stilted, predictable ways that didn’t seem to me to cast a lot of light on things. These observations slowly came together to guide my sense of what I should do: wander the terrain and encounter people; take the time to really hear them out; eschew theory and dwell in the moment; try to convey as true a picture of the world I encountered as I could. No discipline offers fully satisfactory answers to any important question, but journalists needn’t be shy about what we can do with our methods, even as we are conscious of their limitations.

 In May Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pledged $12 billion in new development assistance to African governments and promised technology transfers to make high-speed rail a reality on the continent. His pledge reflects China’s rise to the status of major player in global development finance, with annual development assistance equaling or surpassing aid from the United States, the biggest player in the aid game. In addition, China has had a meteoric rise as an international trader and source of foreign direct investment (FDI).
 
 These trends could be heralded as good news. Trade and financial integration tends to pacify relations between states, creating vested interests that prefer peace to war. As Dartmouth’s Stephen Brooks argues, the rise of global supply and production networks only enhances these tendencies.
 
 Other observers are more skeptical, if not contemptuous. Moisés Naím has called Chinese development assistance “rogue aid,” claiming that it is nondemocratic and harmful to progress and to average citizens. To Stefan Halper, China’s economic rise is “marginalizing the values that have informed Western progress for 300 years.”
 
 These concerns arise from what some call the “Beijing Consensus,” an alternative to the market-oriented logic of the Washington Consensus. The most benign aspect of the “Beijing Consensus” is that China ignores democratic institutions and practices in its investment and aid decisions, focusing exclusively on securing natural resources. Dambisa Moyo likens China to “a 19th century colonial power” determined to exploit resources “to meet its ambitions.” The 21st century commodity boom, in which real prices for most globally traded commodities have more than doubled, has produced a gold rush-like frenzy of investment in exploration by China and other major economies, much of it in parts of Africa plagued by internal political conflicts.
 
 But the Beijing Consensus also points to an illiberal, antidemocratic bent in China’s investment and development assistance, according to other critics. Halper, for example, argues that China prefers to invest in nondemocratic countries and seeks to subvert post-war global governance institutions like the United Nations, the IMF, and the WTO. “China cannot be housebroken,” he says. “It marches to its own drummer.”
 
 These characterizations have not been subjected to rigorous empirical analysis. Are China’s 21st century investment, aid, and security ties disproportionately to nondemocratic countries, reflecting an affinity for authoritarian governments, or does China’s interest in natural resource wealth undermine democratic institutions?
 
 In our recent book, we show some resource-seeking bias in Chinese outward foreign direct investment (OFDI), development assistance, and arms transfers. But this link is not terribly strong or inconsistent with patterns of the US or other major powers.
 
 Some studies putting Chinese OFDI in extractive industries like metals, coal, oil and natural gas at 73.5 percent of all flows at the regional level. Others show Chinese OFDI to be disproportionately targeted toward states with larger natural resource endowments and weaker rule of law. But these correlations do not imply nefarious intent or preference for corrupt environments. The Chinese are relative latecomers and many of the new discoveries that haven’t already been sewn up by Western producers are in states with weak rule of law. Western companies are discouraged from operating in these environments by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Dodd Frank’s Section 1502 rule on conflict minerals, so the upshot is that Chinese producers gravitate toward these relatively undercapitalized markets.
 
 As for aid flows, new data on Chinese activity in Africa suggests, that it appears to be resource motivated. The top 10 recipient countries account for 50 percent of the region’s natural capital and 41 percent of the region’s population but receive 67 percent of Chinese aid. Multivariate statistical models that include proxies for need (population, level of development) and Chinese preferences (i.e., diplomatic recognition of Taiwan) indicate only modest evidence of a resource seeking bent in Chinese development assistance, however. They suggest that the primary drivers of aid are population – more populous countries get more aid – and non-recognition of Taiwan. These findings are consistent with those of Axel Dreher and Andreas Fuchs, who find little evidence of a resource-seeking bias in Chinese aid.
 
 China has pursued a policy of self-sufficiency in arms production. But between 1990-2011, its military transfers, excluding small arms, were comparable to those of the Netherlands, an economy 1/16th its size. The evidence of a resource-seeking bias in China’s arms transfers is weak. By contrast, the evidence is stronger of a resource-seeking bias in the United States’ arms transfers to Africa, a finding similar to Indra de Soysa’s and Paul Midford’s conclusion that Chinese arms transfers to Africa are more likely than US transfers to go to democrats and less likely to go to countries with human rights abuses.
 
 China is hardly unique in shaping its foreign policy around natural resource needs, especially energy. After World War II, the US worried about the foreign policy implications of dependence on oil imports and has evolved policies to military aid and assistance — including troops — to protect Middle Eastern oil producers from Communist aggression or influence. In conclusion, the resource-seeking hypothesis holds for Chinese FDI and, to a lesser extent, development assistance. Arms transfers are not as driven by resource wealth as conventional wisdom would suggest.

 My friend was visibly shaken. He had just learned that he had lost one of his clients to Chinese competitors. ""It’s amazing,"" he told me. ""The Chinese have completely priced us out of the market. We can’t compete with what they are able to offer.""
 
 Of course, manufacturing jobs are lost to China every day. But my friend is not in manufacturing. He works at the World Bank.
 
 His story begins in Nigeria. The Nigerian government operates three railways, which are notoriously corrupt and inefficient. They are also falling apart. The World Bank proposed a project based on the common-sense observation that there was no point in loaning the Nigerians money without also tackling the corruption that had crippled the railways. After months of negotiation, the bank and Nigeria’s government agreed on a $5 million project that would allow private companies to come in and help clean up the railways. But, just as the deal was about to be signed, the Chinese government offered Nigeria $9 billion to rebuild the entire rail network — no bids, no conditions, and no need to reform. That was when my friend packed his suitcase and went to the airport.
 
 It is not an isolated case. In recent years, a variety of wealthy, nondemocratic regimes have begun to undermine development policy through their own activist aid programs. Call it rogue aid. It is development assistance that is nondemocratic in origin and nontransparent in practice; its effect is typically to stifle real progress while hurting average citizens.
 
 China has backed such deals throughout Africa; its funding of infrastructure there has boomed from $700 million in 2003 to between $2 and $3 billion for each of the past two years. Indeed, it is a worldwide strategy. In Indonesia, Beijing agreed to expand the country’s electrical grid. Too bad the deal calls for building plants that use a highly polluting, coal-based Chinese technology. No international agency would have signed off on such an environmentally unfriendly deal. In the Philippines, the Asian Development Bank, which lends money at low interest rates to poor countries, had agreed to fund Manila’s new aqueduct. It too was suddenly told that its money was no longer needed. China was offering lower rates and fewer questions.
 
 What’s behind this sudden Chinese drive to do good around the world? The three short answers are: money, access to raw materials, and international politics. The coffers of China’s Central Bank are bursting with nearly $1.1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves — the world’s largest. Beijing is increasingly leveraging this cash to ensure its access to raw materials while also boosting international alliances that advance China’s growing global influence. What better than a generous foreign-aid program to ensure the goodwill of a petropower like Nigeria or a natural resource-rich neighbor such as Indonesia?
 
 China is not the first country to rely on aid as a tool to advance its interests abroad. The Soviet Union and the United States spent decades giving ""development aid"" to dictators in exchange for their allegiance. Even today, American largesse to Egypt and Pakistan is rooted in geopolitical calculations. But, beginning in the 1990s, this system slowly began to improve. With greater media scrutiny, many developed countries were shamed into curbing these practices. Today, the projects of organizations like the World Bank are meticulously inspected by watchdog groups. Although the current system is far from perfect, it is certainly more transparent than when foreign aid routinely helped ruthless dictators stay in power.
 
 Nor is China the only regime offering rogue aid. President Hugo Chávez has not been shy in using his nation’s oil-fueled international reserves to recruit allies abroad. Indeed, Venezuela’s ambassador to Nicaragua, explaining his country’s large aid packages to the region, bluntly announced in early January, ""We want to infect Latin America with our model."" Thus, hopes for Cuba’s opening as a result of Fidel Castro’s demise and the island’s bankruptcy will likely be dashed by the roughly $2 billion in rogue aid that Chávez supplies to Cuba every year. Worse, his generosity ultimately harms Cubans who, because of these artificial lifelines, will be forced to wait even longer for the indispensable reforms that will bring their society opportunities for true prosperity.
 
 Iranian aid to Hamas in Palestine or Hezbollah in Lebanon is equally damaging to the people there. Clearly, this financial support has boosted Iran’s influence in the region. Far less clear is whether average Palestinians and Lebanese will ever be better off thanks to Iran’s generosity. The same can be said of Saudi Arabia’s massive overseas educational aid program. Are Pakistani boys whose parents cannot afford to send them to school well served by attending Saudi-sponsored religious schools that fail to equip them with the skills needed to get a job? They are surely better off going to any school than being in the streets. But why should these be the only two options? Why can’t the Saudis fund education, the Chinese pay for infrastructure, and Chávez help Cuba’s economy without also hurting poor Pakistanis, Nigerians, or Cubans?
 
 Because their goal is not to help other countries develop. Rather, they are motivated by a desire to further their own national interests, advance an ideological agenda, or sometimes line their own pockets. Rogue aid providers couldn’t care less about the long-term well-being of the population of the countries they ""aid.""
 
 What we have here — in states like China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela — are regimes that have the cash and the will to reshape the world into a place very different from where the rest of us want to live. Although they are not acting in concert, they collectively represent a threat to healthy, sustainable development. Worse, they are effectively pricing responsible and well-meaning aid organizations out of the market in the very places where they are needed most. If they continue to succeed in pushing their alternative development model, they will succeed in underwriting a world that is more corrupt, chaotic, and authoritarian. That is in no one’s interests, except the rogues.","['countries', 'money', 'chinese', 'bank', 'development', 'international', 'china', 'aid', 'world', 'rogue']","{'China': 8, 'Cuba': 5, 'Egypt': 1, 'Indonesia': 2, 'Lebanon': 1, 'Niger': 7, 'Nigeria': 7, 'Nicaragua': 1, 'Pakistan': 3, 'Philippines': 1, 'Saudi Arabia': 2, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

Where will the money go?,"The $60 billion promise matched the pledge total from the previous FOCAC in 2015. But the distribution breakdown is different this time. Here’s what you need to know:
 
 1. Beijing’s pledge will include fewer outright loans and grants.
 
 AD
 
 In delivering the FOCAC 2018 summit opening remarks, Xi pledged $20 billion in new credit lines; $15 billion in foreign aid as grants, interest-free loans or concessional loans; $10 billion for a special fund for development financing; and $5 billion for a special fund for financing imports from Africa. The remaining $10 billion will come from Chinese companies, Xi announced.
 
 AD
 
 While the overall pledged amount is the same as the 2015 Chinese package, there is a decline in the amount pledged as grants and loans. In 2015, China pledged $35 billion in interest-bearing loans and $5 billion in grants and interest-free loans; $5 billion for a special fund for development financing; $5 billion to the China-Africa Development Fund; $5 billion for the Special Loan for the Development of African Small and Medium Enterprises; and $10 billion for the China-Africa production capacity cooperation fund.
 
 Research shows that for three African countries — Djibouti, Congo and Zambia — Chinese loans are the most significant contributor to debt distress. In light of the Sri Lankan government handing over its port of Hambantota on a 99-year lease to China because of failure to pay its debts, fears of such a scenario happening in Africa were present at FOCAC 2018. The lower loan amounts announced this time are likely a result of such fears and a way to control the magnitude of loans in order to lower the risk of debt distress.
 
 AD
 
 Despite China’s foreign aid to Africa rising to $15 billion in 2018 (the largest amount yet announced by China), the figure is still very marginal in the overall foreign aid figures to Africa. For comparison purposes, U.S. foreign aid disbursements to Africa in 2017 were almost equal to what China is offering over the course of the next three years combined.
 
 AD
 
 2. Investment in human capital is rising rapidly.
 
 One area of cooperation that has seen a dramatic increase since the previous FOCAC is China’s investments in human capital and professional training for Africans. Beijing announced higher targets for government-sponsored training opportunities for Africans in China. Xi announced FOCAC 2018’s goal of training 1,000 Africans, hosting 50,000 workshops (in areas as diverse as party politics, sports medicine, agriculture, etc.), awarding 50,000 government scholarships — a big increase from 30,000 in 2015 — and sponsoring 2,000 student exchanges.
 
 AD
 
 According to a study by researchers at Michigan State University, China has already topped the United States and the United Kingdom as a destination for African students. The surge in the numbers of African students in Chinese universities is largely attributed to FOCAC scholarship pledges, and the trend is continuing. To encourage exchanges related to science, technology and entrepreneurship, FOCAC 2018 also launched the China-Africa Innovation Center. Details on location and programming have yet to be revealed.
 
 AD
 
 Vocational training programs and investments in human capital are central to China-Africa relations. Even if it is not always clear what the return on investment is regarding these programs, one thing is clear: They are increasing in number and expanding in scope. For example, the FOCAC 2018 Action Plan pledges training for defense and military personnel, anti-corruption officers, law-enforcement personnel, peacekeeping and police units, agriculture development and local Chinese language teachers.
 
 Beijing uses these training programs to share technical knowledge and transfer expertise — and this effort is well-received by African officials and professionals who participate. Xi also announced plans to open an Institute for African Studies along with 10 Lu Ban workshops across Africa. (These are workshops designed to train youth in manual skills and crafts.)
 
 AD
 
 3. How does the China-Africa Summit tie into broader Chinese goals?
 
 AD
 
 Two African countries registered their first participation in FOCAC: Gambia and Burkina Faso. Both recently broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan and normalized ties with China. This break with Taiwan is necessary to adhere to the “One China” policy, in which the People’s Republic of China is recognized as the only official representation of China. Countries that recognize Taiwan as an independent country are not eligible to receive Chinese investments and aid. In Africa, only Swaziland, also know as eSwatini, retains full diplomatic relations with Taiwan and was the only African country not represented at FOCAC 2018.
 
 FOCAC 2018 also had a strong emphasis on security issues in West African countries, demonstrated in commitments to combating terrorism in the Sahel and fighting piracy off the Gulf of Guinea. Xi announced setting up a China-Africa Peace and Security Fund and launching 50 security assistance programs under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
 
 AD
 
 The BRI is Xi’s flagship foreign policy initiative, aimed at promoting Chinese goods and services to other Asian countries, Africa and Europe — as well as developing China’s interior provinces. BRI was highly marketed during FOCAC 2018 as a platform to bring much-needed development. Securing logistics routes and protecting BRI projects are, in part, what motivates the Chinese government to be involved in security activities in Africa.
 
 AD
 
 Some 18 years after its founding, FOCAC seems to be emerging as an umbrella institution containing several specialized forum initiatives. The Action Plan also announced the establishment of a China-Africa State Governance Forum, China-Africa Agriculture Cooperation Forum, China-Africa Private Sector Forum, China-Africa Developmental Financing Forum, China-Africa Law Enforcement and Security Forum, among others.
 
 This is a new direction for FOCAC but suggests Beijing will use this forum to expand cultural diplomacy mixed with capacity-building programs — and keep the BRI goals at the core of China’s foreign policy. Specific implementation details, when they emerge, may give more insights on Beijing’s priorities — though it seems clear that Chinese investments in human capital and cultural exchanges in Africa are on the rise.

 The money will be focused on infrastructure to help speed African countries’ development, not on “vanity projects,” Xi said.
 
 AD
 
 Details were vague, but the $60 billion included $15 billion in grants, interest-free loans and concessional loans, $20 billion in credit lines and a $10 billion special fund for development financing. Chinese companies also will be encouraged to invest at least $10 billion in Africa over the next three years, state media reported.
 
 The package outlined by Xi also includes medical aid, environmental protection, agricultural training and assistance, and government scholarships and vocational training for more than 100,000 young Africans.
 
 AD
 
 At the last forum, held in Johannesburg three years ago, Xi also pledged $60 billion in investment. He said Monday that this money had already been granted or earmarked, so the latest announcement represented a second round of $60 billion.
 
 The program is part of Xi’s broader Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious $120-billion-plus project that aims to link 65 countries in Europe, Asia and Africa — together accounting for almost two-thirds of the world’s population — through infrastructure projects and trade.

 At a time when President Trump is engaged in trade fights with the United States’ neighbors and allies, the Chinese leader seems to relish the opportunity to appear as a popular international statesman and champion of the liberal economic order.
 
 AD
 
 For two days in a row, every headline on the front page of the state-run People’s Daily started with the words “Xi Jinping,” as the president met with the leaders of Angola, Gabon, Mauritius, Senegal and elsewhere. He also hosted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who has been charged by the International Criminal Court with war crimes and crimes against humanity.
 
 Over the past two decades, China has gone from being a relatively small investor in Africa to becoming the continent’s largest economic partner, with bilateral trade growing at about 20 percent annually, according to a report last year from the consultancy McKinsey. Foreign direct investment has grown even faster over the past decade, at about 40 percent a year, it found.
 
 AD
 
 But critics say that with many of its infrastructure projects, China is luring needy countries into “debt traps.”
 
 AD
 
 Take Sri Lanka, which last year had no choice but to grant China a 99-year lease for a Belt and Road Initiative port after it failed to attract enough business to make its loan payments.
 
 Last month, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad canceled more than $20 billion worth of planned Chinese infrastructure projects, saying he was concerned about paying for them. “We do not want a situation where there is a new version of colonialism happening because poor countries are unable to compete with rich countries,” he said during a visit to Beijing.
 
 Analysts have raised concerns about African countries, many of which are subject to the whims of commodity markets, not being able to repay Chinese loans.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 The three countries most vulnerable because of large debts owed to China are Djibouti, Congo and Zambia, say academics at the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University. Zambia, which has a gross domestic product of $19.5 billion, according to the World Bank, had taken about $6.4 billion in loans from China, the researchers wrote in a briefing paper last month.
 
 But Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who chairs the African Union, said that rather than viewing the investment as a “debt trap,” other countries should be asking why they’re not giving Africa as much assistance as China.
 
 “We have benefited a lot from China’s support in our social and economic programs, and that has continued to strengthen the partnership between China and Rwanda,” Kagame told the People’s Daily.
 
 AD
 
 He also got in a dig at Trump, saying the forum “can show the world how countries can work collaboratively at a time when issues like trade protectionism continue to brew.”
 
 AD
 
 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa also rebuffed suggestions that China is taking advantage of the continent. The leaders “refute the view that a new colonialism is taking hold in Africa, as our detractors would have us believe,” he told the forum.
 
 Chinese state media outlets have been aggressively explaining why such investment is good for the continent — and positioning Xi as the champion of the African people.
 
 “Africa is still at the initial stage of industrialization, and the process is very likely to collapse without sustainable investment growth,” the state-linked Global Times reported Monday. Chinese loans can help African countries improve their infrastructure, it said.
 
 AD
 
 “We believe African people, instead of Western observers, know best what is most needed by the continent,” stated the paper, which often reflects official thinking. In an editorial, the paper said that the West just had “sour grapes” over China’s good relations with Africa.","['pledges', 'countries', 'attached', 'africa', 'chinese', 'political', 'conditions', 'infrastructure', '60', 'african', 'billion', 'china', 'president', 'aid', 'xi', 'loans', 'investment']","{'Angola': 1, 'China': 13, 'Congo': 1, 'Djibouti': 1, 'Gabon': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'Mauritius': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Rwanda': 2, 'Sudan': 1, 'Senegal': 1, 'United States': 1, 'South Africa': 1, 'Zambia': 2}",,,,,

 Next week, presidents and ministers from across Africa will make their way to Beijing for the seventh Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, a lavish pageant designed to showcase China’s engagement with African nations. At the last FOCAC, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged a massive $60 billion in commercial loans to Africa, a sum that far outstrips U.S. lending and investments. But Washington shouldn’t necessarily be alarmed—at least not yet.
 
 Since the first FOCAC in 2000, China has grown from bit player in Africa to the source of nearly $200 billion in trade. From 2001 and 2011, China also committed $75 billion in aid to the continent, about 20 percent of the $404 billion total that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee calculated for the period. The United States promised somewhat more—$90 billion in the same period—but Chinese aid is more sought after. Unlike Western assistance, which comes mainly in the form of outright transfers of cash and materiel, Chinese assistance consists mostly of export credits and loans for infrastructure (often with little or no interest) that are fast, flexible, and largely without conditions. Thanks to such loans, the International Monetary Fund estimates that, as of 2012, China owned about 15 percent of sub-Saharan Africa’s total external debt, up from only 2 percent in 2005. And McKinsey & Co. reckons that, as of 2015, Chinese loans accounted for about a third of new debt being taken on by African governments.
 
 Many observers have warned of the real risk of Chinese lending undermining African sovereignty and U.S. interests in the region. For example, in remarks early this year, then-U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson acknowledged that “Chinese investment does have the potential to address Africa’s infrastructure gap” but at the same time lamented that “its approach has led to mounting debt and few, if any, jobs in most countries” even as it “encourages dependency using opaque contracts, predatory loan practices, and corrupt deals that mire nations in debt and undercut their sovereignty, denying them their long-term, self-sustaining growth.”
 
 Take, for example, the tiny, sparsely populated East African country of Djibouti, which Tillerson visited during what turned out to be his last trip as America’s chief diplomat. Since 2002, it has been home to the largest U.S. military base in Africa, which is used as a launchpad for counterterrorism operations in East Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula. In the last two years alone, Djibouti has borrowed $1.4 billion from China—an astronomical sum for a country of barely a million people. That’s more than three-quarters of Djibouti’s GDP. Beijing has leveraged this money to open its first overseas military installation, which is located in Djibouti City next to a port that is also owned and operated by China. The base has badly crowded U.S. operations and has been used to harass U.S. pilots. Perhaps even worse, Beijing’s resident ambassador has reportedly told diplomats that his country expects to be repaid either in cash or in kind, raising the specter that Beijing intends to expand its military footprint in the country—whether its government likes it or not.
 
 The Djibouti example aside, though, Chinese loans are neither inherently good nor bad—they will be whatever the African nations choose to make of them. Increased competition for African real estate and resources should, in theory, enhance the bargaining power of African governments, which is inarguably a good thing. The question, however, is whether African leaders will rise to the occasion or whether they will settle for deals that may deliver short-term gains but at significant long-term costs.
 
 Kenya is a good case study of how to leverage the opportunities. In late August, President Uhuru Kenyatta met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House, and the two leaders announced the establishment of a United States-Kenya Trade and Investment Working Group and promised to find financing for a superhighway between the capital of Nairobi and the port of Mombasa. It will be built by the U.S. construction giant Bechtel. After a quick trip home, Kenyatta embarked for the FOCAC meeting, where he will likely sign further deals on top of the $3.2 billion Chinese-funded, -built, and -operated Madaraka Express railway between Nairobi and Mombasa that opened last year. In combination, the new U.S.-funded superhighway and additional Chinese-supplied railway infrastructure will leave Kenya better equipped for international trade.
 
 The question, however, is whether more African leaders will follow that lead. If they use Chinese financing as a patch for poor governance and irresponsible fiscal policies, then China’s no-strings-attached approach to doing business could indeed be disastrous. It could become, in the words of Lamido Sanusi, the former governor of the Nigerian Central Bank (and now emir of Kano) a “new form of imperialism,” consisting primarily of extracting resources and selling finished products back to Africans, without much in the way of technology and skills transfers in between. If African nations are more strategic about the use of Chinese aid though, then it could not only help the continent build necessary power and road infrastructure but also spur economic growth. The World Bank estimates that if the region could just close its infrastructure gap with the median of the rest of the developing world, GDP per capita would increase by 1.7 percentage points per year.
 
 Weakly democratic governments in Africa could also let Chinese investment become a full replacement for Western assistance on the grounds that Western help comes with too many conditions. In doing so, they would miss out on a source of funding that could lead to long-term economic health. It is not lost on observers that while Chinese funds have poured into virtually every corner of Africa, nearly 75 percent of the investments have gone to just 10 countries, among which only one, South Africa, is classified as “free” in Freedom House’s 2018 Freedom in the World report.
 
 The United States and its partners should not be naive about China’s advance across the continent, but they should not view its rival’s involvement as a zero-sum game, either—not least because Africans would not welcome such an approach. The world stands to gain from China’s engagement in Africa. China is the only global actor that is realistically capable of relieving (or, at least to date, has even shown interest in) tackling Africa’s enormous infrastructure deficit, especially in power and transport, which will cost a staggering $90 billion every year for the next decade to address. And China needs Africa’s natural resources and export markets to fuel its own growth.
 
 But the partnership will only pay off if the infrastructure projects that China underwrites are high-quality, commercially sound, socially responsible, and well-managed. And there is no reason they can’t be. However, it is up to African leaders to drive harder bargains and African publics to demand transparency in the terms of contracts, especially where land or commodity futures are at stake. The more competitors there are in the aid space, the easier that will be.
 
 The Trump administration’s National Security Strategy recognizes Africa’s economic potential and a strategic need to provide an alternative to China’s “often extractive economic footprint” on the continent. This is all well and good, but it assumes that U.S. businesses will be present and engaged across Africa alongside America’s diplomats, development specialists, and military personnel in ways that they currently are not. If African leaders are partying—and signing deals—in Beijing, it is because they need what those partnerships promise. It is in everyone’s interest that the United States and other developed countries both match those moves and raise them as well.

Here’s what that means.,"There’s another important dimension of this aid package. This featured prominently in Xi’s keynote speech, when he stressed that China’s aid and loan to Africa will not “come with any political conditions attached.” This promise of unconditional aid is in contrast to most aid from traditional donors — who usually require the recipient to undergo changes in governance structure and adhere to international “best practices.”

 To be sure, China’s aid and development financing do come with other strings that are tied in with Beijing’s commercial interests or foreign-policy objectives, such as upholding the “one China” policy. But the absence of political conditions makes this aid more attractive to countries that struggle with fulfilling requirements such as reducing corruption and increasing accountability.
 
 What are the consequences of China’s “no political strings attached” aid for traditional donors?
 
 Conditionality is difficult to enforce when there are multiple donors
 
 Aid conditionality is particularly difficult to enforce when there are multiple donors with competing priorities. This was the case during the Cold War, when the United States and Soviet Union gave aid to “strengthen corrupt but geopolitically useful autocracies.” With the end of the Cold War, Western donors were able to commit more credibly to using conditionality to push for governance changes.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 China’s rise as a major donor and investor in Africa has led to renewed competition in the continent. The European Union, for example, launched the Africa-E.U. Strategic Partnership in 2007 and pledged to mobilize more than $54 billion in sustainable investment for Africa by 2020. In July 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act to compete with China’s growing presence in Africa.
 
 A consequence of this competition is that countries unwilling or unable to implement the political changes required by traditional donors may turn to China as an alternative source of funding. This may lead to a delay in changes that improve the quality of governance in these countries.
 
 Nevertheless, competition between China and the West is not, by definition, a bad thing for Africa. African leaders, for example, welcome China’s increased role in the continent, reporting that “competition between donors has had positive consequences for African development” by giving African countries “options after several decades of a largely Western development model.”
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 What comes first, good governance or development?
 
 One question to ask is whether good governance leads to economic development. This is one of the underlying assumptions of making aid conditional. Some scholars suggest the causal arrow may actually be reversed — that is, some initial level of economic development is needed to enable institutions of good governance to generate further growth and development. In fact, China’s own development trajectory demonstrates that the relationship between governance and growth cannot be simplified as a “chicken-or-egg” issue.
 
 Recent evidence shows that China can help countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia realize such initial growth through investment and industrialization. A study based on extensive fieldwork in Africa similarly concludes that “China’s growing involvement is strongly positive for Africa’s economies, governments, and workers.” On a broader scale, scholars have found that Chinese-funded infrastructure projects result in increased economic activities and reduced inequality.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 The bottom line is that there is nothing inherently good or bad about China’s aid and investment, though the “no political strings attached” approach means that the potential benefits can more easily be compromised by corruption and local politics. Researchers at AidData, for instance, find that Chinese development finance projects tend to be more concentrated in birth regions of African leaders and politicians — rather than regions that are the most in need.
 
 China could coordinate with traditional donors to promote development
 
 There has been some pushback from within China, calling for the restructuring of its aid regime. This has led to the promulgation of the new Measures for the Administration of Foreign Aid in 2015 and the establishment of the State International Development Cooperation Agency this year.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 Recent public outcry in China over the $60 billion package further suggests that Beijing may face more domestic scrutiny over its aid policies, particularly in light of concerns about an economic slowdown and the ongoing trade war with the United States.
 
 The bigger pressure, however, will probably come from the risk of defaults in countries that receive billions of dollars from China. Such risks have reportedly prompted Beijing to reconsider its development finance strategies.
 
 This points to opportunities for more coordinated efforts for China and traditional donors to each focus on what they do best — building infrastructure and institutions at the same time. This type of cooperation potentially can amplify the benefits for local communities in Africa. The recently signed memorandum of cooperation between the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the African Development Bank would be a step toward this goal.

 China’s WIPO leadership bid is just the latest part of its comprehensive effort to assume control of as many U.N. and multilateral organizations as possible. Smartly, Beijing has recognized the importance of playing a leading role in global governance and has devoted enormous resources to its plan.

 Last June, Qu Dongyu, China’s vice foreign minister for agriculture, defeated the U.S.-backed candidate to become the head of the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization by a vote of 108 to 12. That shock spurred a new effort by the United States to up its game.

Several sources have said that candidate is Singapore’s candidate, Daren Tang.
 
 The U.S. effort is hampered by the administration’s public contempt for the multilateralism and its damaged relationships with allies. Victory is by no means assured.

Since the 19th century, China has seen itself as an unequal partner in international treaties. In fact, from 1840 to 1949, China was pressured into disadvantageous international accords that limited its autonomy on the global stage.
 
 Even though these treaties restricted China’s freedoms in the international sphere, they often served to bolster domestic authority, ultimately conferring recognition and legitimacy on the Chinese government. Today, the trade deal with the United States may do the same. Despite making difficult concessions, China may be using the international system to bolster its sovereign authority over domestic matters. And by recognizing China as an equal partner, the United States may help legitimize the Chinese Communist Party and its undemocratic practices at home.

 For more than a century, China — first as the Qing Empire and then as the Republic of China — was bound in a system of semi-colonial subjugation, a system enshrined and codified in “unequal treaties” that foreign powers compelled China to sign. The 19th-century treaties contained a peculiar combination of imperial paternalism and liberal tenets of international law, including sovereignty and reciprocity. These agreements allowed foreigners to enjoy extraterritoriality on Chinese soil while the Chinese government lost the ability to regulate the flow of goods across its borders and the autonomy to set tariffs.
 
 As a result, China was forced into the global economy on highly disadvantageous terms. But in complying with these terms — partly through political innovation and partly by circumstance — China discovered it could turn unequal international treatment into a domestic advantage. As long as the Qing adhered to international conventions in matters of trade and diplomacy, it was able to treat its subjects at home as it saw fit. The international concessions shielded China from foreign interference, and, with its domestic authority ensured by recognition of its sovereignty, the Qing could defer reforms to its centuries-old justice system and imperial bureaucracy.
 
 Consider for example, the practice of extraterritoriality. Long the poster case for the humiliating injustice of the treaty system, scholars have shown how it layered neatly on top of an imperial Chinese legal system that already differentiated among subjects based on their identity. The Qing legal code was already applied in different ways to the ruling Manchu ethnic group than to the ethnically Han majority, a practice that not only made the unequal treatment of Europeans easily legible in the Chinese context, but that was also reinforced when foreign powers codified similar judicial differentiation in their treaties.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 In short, the “unequal treaties”— deleterious though they may have been — had a legitimizing effect on the Chinese governments that signed them. The economic concessions were a (high) price to be paid in exchange for international recognition and tacit endorsement.
 
 Despite the fact the Qing derived some legitimacy from these treaties, they have long figured in the Chinese imagination as symbols of the imperial power of the West. In fact, the Chinese Communist Party, since coming to power in 1949, has marshaled the historical memory of these injustices to stir up patriotic, nationalist sentiment among its citizens. By proclaiming an end to the “century of humiliation,” in the middle of the 20th century the CCP positioned itself as China’s savior from these historical international injustices.
 
 But this idea of “humiliation,” while politically powerful, ignores the historical reality that these treaties also served an important role for “accommodating the West and giving it a place within the Chinese world,” according to the historian John Fairbank. The unequal treaties themselves bolstered Chinese state power at the time — but then so did the CCP’s pointed rejection of them as humiliating.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 Today’s treaties afford the Chinese government another chance to consolidate domestic power. In accepting provisions about, for example, intellectual property — an idea long rejected as a Western creation designed to preserve American hegemony — the People’s Republic may be making a symbolic concession to American demands. With key elements of China’s proposed new international order — China’s free trade agreement for Asia and the Belt and Road Initiative — seemingly on hold, leaders in Beijing are turning inward. With economic growth no longer as robust and growing civil unrest, the Chinese Communist Party is more concerned with internal matters than global leadership.
 
 And so, this trade deal echoes a familiar strategy, one pursued in the 19th century by the Qing government to use the international system to bolster its sovereign authority over domestic matters.
 
 In Trump, China has found an interlocutor who is willing to look past an ever-growing litany of internal abuses to secure economic advantages. Trump’s trade deal and his willingness to laud China’s adherence to international norms while the rest of the world decries internment camps in Xinjiang suggest he is prepared to reverse decades of U.S. foreign policy that linked China’s access to the global system with a human rights agenda. Between Trump’s need to deliver on a campaign promise ahead of November and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s slightly diminished international status, an increasingly authoritarian Beijing is in search of legitimacy, and the White House is willing to provide it for a price.

 Will the Iran crisis distract the United States from long-term threats from great powers? Here’s what we know.
 
 AD
 
 The Iran crisis could drag on
 
 Can the United States deal with an immediate military crisis — which may turn out to drag on for a while — while still planning for and adjusting its military forces for long-term competition with China?
 
 Elbridge Colby, one of the principal authors of the National Defense Strategy, and Wess Mitchell argue in a recent Foreign Affairs article that “engaging in a war with Iran, sustaining a large military presence in Afghanistan, or intervening in Venezuela, as some in the administration want to do, is antithetical to success in a world of great-power competition.”
 
 AD
 
 As I have argued elsewhere, existing and potentially declining great powers, such as the United States, are compelled to have short time horizons — while rising powers tend to have longer time horizons. Here’s why: Existing powers that face immediate threats must address those while paying less attention to long-term and less certain threats. Rising powers recognize that their brightest days are ahead, and they welcome opportunities in the short term to bolster their long-term prospects.
 
 AD
 
 China might benefit from the U.S. preoccupation with Iran
 
 A potential conflict between the United States and Iran might pose some challenges for Russia and China, but a crisis also presents opportunities.
 
 AD
 
 First, with Washington distracted, Beijing and Moscow may pursue their own interests with less concern about a U.S. reaction. Were China to act even more ambitiously in the South China Sea — or Russia to seek to expand its influence both regionally and globally — the U.S. ability to respond either militarily, economically or diplomatically might be constrained by its focus on Iran.
 
 Second, a military conflict in Iran would have significant implications for U.S. resources, including the deployment of substantial U.S. forces. As Joshua Rovner points out, a conflict in Iran means a continuing large force presence in the Middle East — and that may make it more difficult for the United States to pivot its attention to great-power competition. Conflict in Iran may also make it even more difficult for the United States to extricate itself from Afghanistan — even if that’s what President Trump wants to do.
 
 AD
 
 Third, tensions with Iran may have adverse consequences for the U.S. relationship with allies who might be useful for confronting emerging great-power threats.
 
 AD
 
 America’s relations with its European allies are already strained by disagreements over the airstrike that killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani — as well as the bigger picture of how to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. European allies are unlikely to be willing participants in a U.S. military conflict with Iran.
 
 Those same allies are vital to managing Russian aggression and play an increasingly important role in responding to the rise of China. Despite the president’s suggestion to expand NATO’s mission to the Middle East, such a move probably would only intensify disagreement with European allies over Iran, fray the NATO alliance further, and undermine efforts to balance against Russia.
 
 AD
 
 Uncertain of U.S. strategic priorities, those same allies may pursue their own strategy toward China rather than acting in concert with the United States. In short, alienating U.S. allies over a conflict with Iran may undermine U.S. efforts to balance either great power.
 
 AD
 
 But the news is not all good for China and Russia
 
 Both China and Russia have consistently signaled their opposition to Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons, including sustaining their commitments to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action even as the Trump administration withdrew from the agreement. If a conflict with Iran encourages Tehran to accelerate its nuclear program, presumably neither Beijing nor Moscow would welcome this development.
 
 As resurgent and emerging great powers, Russia and China will also want to guard against short-term developments that might interfere with their long-term ambitions. China is Iran’s biggest trading partner and imported $15 billion of Iranian crude in 2018. While these imports are down since the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran and while China has diversified the sources of its energy imports, Beijing is most likely wary of any conflict that would disrupt global energy markets.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 Moreover, China’s Belt and Road Initiative has expanded China’s presence around the world, including in the Middle East. A U.S. conflict with Iran could very well complicate China’s presence in the region, including its deepening ties with Saudi Arabia. China’s interests in both the stability of energy markets and these Belt and Road projects would contribute to Chinese concern about any conflict in the region.
 
 Russian President Vladimir Putin has visited his Syrian allies even in the midst of the current crisis, but a heavier and more active U.S. presence in the region could complicate the pursuit of Russia’s interests. Avoiding an inadvertent conflict between the United States and Russia has been a concern in Syria, and those risks could increase with a larger U.S. military presence in the region — which would be likely if the U.S.-Iran conflict escalates.
 
 In sum, Russia and China might benefit from a simmering crisis between the United States and Iran, but they might also prefer to avoid that simmer growing into a boil. A military conflict could reverberate in unpredictable ways, with unwelcome implications for both China and Russia.

 For the United States, to the extent that the National Security Strategy and the National Defense Strategy correctly identify the most significant challenges to U.S. national security, the Iran crisis illustrates the difficulty of planning and implementing a long-term grand strategy to address those still-emerging threats.
 
 In grand strategy, as in life, it’s hard to walk and chew gum at the same time.

 The construction is fueled mostly by lending from China’s state-run banks. Spindles of Chinese-paved roads have unfurled across the continent, along with huge bridges, new airports, dams and power plants as part of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s 152-country Belt and Road Initiative.

 “The Chinese are thinking far into the long-term in Djibouti and Africa in general,” said David Shinn, a former U.S. ambassador to Ethiopia who was also the State Department’s desk officer for Djibouti as far back as the late 1960s. “Djibouti is one node in an economic chain that stretches across the northern rim of the Indian Ocean, from ports in Cambodia to Sri Lanka to Pakistan.

 In Djibouti, that strategic plan is all the more evident because of the country’s location at the entrance to the Red Sea, where about 10 percent of oil exports and 20 percent of commercial goods pass through the narrow strait right off Djibouti’s coast on their way to and from the Suez Canal.
 
 That location has made it a crucial waypoint for undersea cables, which transmit data between continents. China’s investment in Internet infrastructure here comes as the region surrounding Djibouti is just starting to come online, including some places that are entirely reliant on Djibouti as a transit point for data transmission.

 The transformative presence of China on so many fronts has loosened many African countries’ dependence on Western governments for development.
 
 Chinese loans come without the demands for improvements on human rights that often accompany American aid. China’s inroads have helped it gain access to vital mineral resources, a vast market looking for its cheap goods located at the center of the world map, and reliable backing at global institutions such as the United Nations.
 
 But critics of Chinese loans allege that they catch vulnerable, developing countries in “debt traps,” depleting government coffers and sticking generations of taxpayers with gigantic bills, or else China’s banks take ownership of the key strategic assets they built. Beijing now holds over 70 percent of Djibouti’s gross domestic product in debt.

 African governments have fiercely denied that such takeovers could happen, despite recent precedent in Sri Lanka, where a port in the president’s strategically located but commercially unviable hometown was handed back to the Chinese company that financed its construction.
 
 The Trump administration has sought to counter China’s growing influence with a push for private investment, called Prosper Africa, though the investments envisioned would pale in comparison to Chinese loans. In Djibouti, even the commander of U.S. armed forces in Africa has appealed — if obliquely — for greater caution in dealing with China.
 
 “We look to build enduring relationships, not short term, nor transactional ones,” Gen. Stephen J. Townsend said on a visit to Djibouti this summer. “We lead with our values, hard work and a desire to strengthen partnerships on the African continent.”

 The U.S. military’s main base in Africa, home to 4,000 personnel and a fleet of drones, has been in Djibouti for two decades. The United States has essentially paid hundreds of millions of dollars in rent for its base, where it stages fitful attempts to degrade al-Shabab in neighboring Somalia, but has done little else to develop the country.
 
 While many African governments, including Djibouti’s, have expressed hope for greater American investment, Beijing puts its money where its mouth is, and cash-strapped African governments have turned east almost in unison. The Chinese leader now hosts an annual Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, attended by nearly all of Africa’s 54 heads of state. At the launch of Prosper Africa in Mozambique this year, the United States failed to send even a Cabinet secretary.
 
 “Yes, our debt to China is 71% of our GDP, but we needed that infrastructure,” Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, Djibouti’s foreign affairs minister, said in a phone interview on the sidelines of a meeting in New York earlier this month, where Djibouti was pushing to gain a nonpermanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.

 “It was quite natural that we raise our partnership with China. Neither Europe nor America were ready to build the infrastructure we needed. We’re projecting our country into the future and looking after the well-being of our people. Even the United States has trillions of dollars in debt to China, you know,” Youssouf said.
 
 The most significant investment China has made in Djibouti is Doraleh Port, Africa’s biggest and deepest. As with Internet through the data center, a full 90 percent of landlocked Ethiopia’s imports now transit Djibouti, giving the minuscule country, with a population of less than a million, leverage over its gigantic, 100-million-strong neighbor.
 
 And it isn’t just that Chinese banks control Africa’s largest port. Chinese companies are its main users.
 
 “The majority of our shipping is coming from China,” said Aboubaker Omar Hadi, chairman of the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority.
 
 The paradox for many in the United States is that it is precisely the authoritarian political system in China, much maligned in Washington, that gives it an upper hand in economic competition. An added local irony for American policymakers is that the United States initially welcomed China’s presence in Djibouti as part of an international force to defeat rampant piracy in the region. Almost all of China’s investments in Djibouti have come after that mission ended.

 “Trade, investment, politics, military are all closely linked in China’s foreign policy — that’s the way it is under the Communist Party,” said Joshua Eisenmann, an expert on China at the University of Notre Dame.
 
 American banks are too risk-averse to make the large loans in Africa that China’s state-operated banks do, Eisenmann said. Especially under an administration that has been hawkish toward countering China on the global stage, there’s a fear that China could even one day use its leverage to hamper American access in places like Djibouti to its own bases.
 
 “China has tools that the American government doesn’t — namely government-backed financing of loans,” said Shinn, the former U.S. ambassador. “I don’t care what Trump says — American trade in Africa is falling off a cliff. The whole Africa policy has that central flaw.”

That swagger has faded a bit.,"But Xi’s message — once triumphant — was distinctively conciliatory.
 
 Two years after the Chinese leader launched the initiative to exuberant fanfare, foreign diplomats and international observers say they have sensed a shift in tone — perhaps even downsized ambitions — as China faces stinging international criticism and rising questions about the project’s fiscal and environmental feasibility.

 “We must adhere to the concept of openness, greenness and cleanliness,” Xi said Friday as he defended his project, which envisions ports, highways, rail lines and other links across Asia and beyond.
 
 But with investments across Asia stalling or scaled back and the Chinese economy slowing, Beijing has had to dampen its propaganda — and quietly tighten up the flow of investments into the Belt and Road initiatives, analysts say.
 
 “The Belt and Road has most certainly been a learning process,” said Zha Daojiong, a professor at the Institute of South-South Cooperation and Development at Peking University. “Some scaling back is normal. The scale — including the number of entities that formally subscribe to the initiative — is less significant than the quality of the projects.”
 
 AD
 
 As criticism grew last summer, Xi instructed officials to clean up the program with a traditional Chinese painting metaphor. If the Belt and Road was painted with freehand technique before, he said, it should now be done with detailed brushstrokes.
 
 AD
 
 Last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi publicly welcomed “constructive opinions” about what China could do better. Days later, China’s No. 2 leader, Premier Li Keqiang, made just a passing reference to the Belt and Road in a speech to Asian heads of state and financiers as he promised reform for China’s trade practices.
 
 This week, along Beijing’s boulevards, billboards for the forum promise “extensive consultations” and “mutual learning” between China and its partners.
 
 AD
 
 State media, meanwhile, has been relatively muted compared to 2017, when the propaganda machine unleashed a slew of triumphant media coverage, English-language cartoons and singalong music videos extolling how China’s financial largesse was benefiting mankind.
 
 Mentions of Belt and Road in the Communist Party’s agenda-setting People’s Daily newspaper have fallen sharply in the past year, suggesting an effort by central leaders to downplay the program, said Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College.
 
 “We see a decrease in the amount of effusive rhetoric because there’s not really that much good news to report,” Pei said.
 
 Chinese government data suggests China may be dialing back its overseas investments. In the first quarter of 2019, China’s nonfinancial investments in Belt and Road countries grew 4 percent compared to 22 percent a year prior, its lowest rate in years, Bloomberg News reported.

 While the Belt and Road plan has caught flak from expected quarters — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and top Pentagon officials have sounded dire warnings about China ensnaring smaller countries in “debt traps” — Chinese officials are perhaps more alarmed that some traditional partners have wavered on their commitments.
 
 In the past year, newly elected governments in Malaysia and Pakistan have sought to renegotiate Chinese loan packages. Myanmar and Nepal have backed away from agreements for China to build dams, ports and power plants, questioning whether the debt burden would be too great.
 
 China hit a public relations quagmire in late 2017 when Sri Lanka, struggling to make debt payments, handed control over a port and swath of territory for 99 years to China. The concession carried historical echoes of China’s humiliating transfer of Hong Kong to colonial Britain in the 19th century, and reinforced U.S. claims that China is a new colonial power in the making.

 Meanwhile at home, Chinese intellectuals have questioned privately — and in rare instances, publicly — the wisdom of funneling national riches to far-flung countries at a time of slowing economic growth and rising unemployment.
 
 Last year, Xu Zhangrun, an influential law professor at Tsinghua University, rebuked Xi in a widely read essay for playing the “flashy big-spender” who invested in vanity projects in the Middle East when more than 100 million Chinese lived below the poverty line. Tsinghua suspended Xu from teaching this month, but similar criticisms have surfaced on Chinese social media and circulate frequently among Chinese intellectuals, said the Claremont McKenna professor Pei.
 
 “To a person, they think this is folly,” Pei said. “The government isn’t unaware of the criticisms, but because of political conformity and the climate of fear in China, very few would dare to say anything negative.”
 
 AD

 Still, China has forged ahead. Despite notable exceptions including the United States, India, Germany and France, there are now 126 countries involved or pledging support for China’s Belt and Road plans.
 
 Last month, Xi scored a diplomatic coup on a trip to Rome as Italy signed an agreement to become the first Western European participant in the Belt and Road despite behind-the-scenes lobbying by U.S., French and German officials.
 
 Nadège Rolland, a scholar at the National Bureau of Asian Research, said the Chinese government will “refine” the rough edges of the Belt and Road program, not abandon it.
 
 The project, which has been closely linked to Xi’s political legacy and enshrined into China’s national constitution since 2017, is fundamentally aligned with the Communist Party’s objective of expanding overseas markets for China and expanding its economic and geopolitical footprint, she said.

 In a sense, the Sicomines resources-for-infrastructure agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been just another underperforming deal in a country with no shortage of them. But it is also more than that — namely, a window into the flaws at the heart of Chinese international economic policy, which is already costing its economy dearly.
 
 At the turn of the century, the Chinese government started implementing its “Go Out” policy, which sought to incentivize domestic firms to look for business overseas. Chinese firms would invest and seek contracts abroad, which would make them more competitive globally while alleviating some of the pressures of a domestic market that was starting to saturate. At the same time, the move would allow Chinese firms to secure new markets for their exports. The policy was supported by cheap and easy credit from China’s policy banks.
 
 Chinese firms responded to these incentives. Fueled by easy credit and the impetus to go out, many of them have been taking increasingly risky projects. Unsurprisingly, many of these projects have underperformed massively. And the impacts for Chinese banks, and through them the Chinese economy, are now becoming visible.
 
 Consider Congo’s Sicomines agreement. In 2007, the Congolese government signed an enormous resource-for-infrastructure deal originally valued at $9 billion with a consortium of Chinese companies. According to the fleshed-out version of the agreement, signed in 2008, more than 10 million metric tons of copper and some 600,000 metric tons of cobalt were ceded to the newly minted Sicomines, of which the major Chinese state-owned enterprises China Railway Engineering Corp. (CREC) and Sinohydro had majority ownership. In exchange, Sicomines would build $6 billion (later adjusted to $3 billion) worth of infrastructure and invest $3 billion in the mine itself. China’s Export-Import Bank agreed to finance the whole thing, with the guarantee that the mine’s output would serve to repay its loans down the line.
 
 Ostensibly, the deal was good for China. Through Sicomines, it would gain a new friend in Joseph Kabila. (Relevant here is that in 2007, unlike today, Kabila had just won Congo’s first ever democratic election and was portrayed as a figure of hope for stability, democracy, and development.) The Chinese side of the agreement would also secure massive mineral reserves. Finally, China would offload some of its domestic overcapacity by carrying out $9 billion worth of investments halfway across the world. According to new research — based on dozens of interviews and an in-depth financial model of the agreement — the deal had a net value more than $10 billion to the Chinese consortium when it was signed. But the deal soured.
 
 The Chinese consortium misjudged the market it was entering. As can be expected from any venture in one of the world’s least stable countries, also infamous for its infrastructure deficit, massive delays plagued the development of the mine. For example, after failing to secure electricity from the Congolese grid at the agreed-upon price, Sicomines had to import electricity from Zambia. It is now in the process of building a hydroelectric plant, without which the mine cannot produce at full capacity. Sicomines also got unlucky. In 2013, news broke out that the total estimated copper reserves in its concession had been adjusted down to 6.8 million metric tons — a 35 percent drop. Mirroring this drop, the consortium readjusted its copper production targets down by 37.5 percent. To make things worse, in the years following the signature of the deal, the price of minerals took a hit. Copper now costs under $7,000 per metric ton, down from about $9,000 when the deal was finalized in April 2008. As things stood in late 2016, Sicomines may result in a substantial net loss for the Chinese consortium.
 
 The Sicomines case is not unusual. China’s mammoth firms frequently make massive losses on foreign investment ventures.
 
 A recent Foreign Policy piece points out that individuals and firms have made up an increasingly large share of China’s total foreign asset purchases in recent years, from 12 percent in 2011 to nearly 40 percent in 2017, as the People’s Bank of China’s share of total foreign direct investment shrank. It turns out that these new investors are poor asset judges. As their share of China’s portfolio grew, its aggregate returns dwindled. In 2016, the total return on Chinese foreign investment was 0.4 percent, which is dramatically lower than the 4 percent earned by foreign reserves.
 
 Through the Go Out policy and the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s firms have been economically and politically incentivized to invest in countries where they have little to no experience. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative has backed the Go Out policy’s economic incentives with a healthy dose of political pressure, reflecting China’s desire to have its economic rise matched by political clout. Chinese firms lack the experience of their Western counterparts when investing abroad; some Western investments date back to colonial times. Because of their late entry into new markets, Chinese firms may also be more likely to invest in lemons — projects deemed too unprofitable or risky by other investors. Chinese firms have also been taking on projects that are far outside their field of competence. The Sicomines deal is a case in point, resulting in two Chinese construction giants now sharing a controlling stake in a copper mine.
 
 The possibility has been raised that Chinese firms may be in a haste to invest in large projects, regardless of risk, because they aim to become too big to fail, with the expectation that they will be bailed out even if they throw money down the drain. They may also be seeking to transfer assets abroad to shield them from the state’s prying hands should their political fortunes turn.
 
 Regardless of Chinese firms’ motives for undertaking such risky projects abroad, failed investments are now fixtures of China’s foreign investment portfolio. Furthermore, many of these projects are on the books of the Chinese policy banks that finance them. These banks expect all their loans to be repaid — and are unlikely to forgive them. However, they will likely be forced to renegotiate or even reschedule many loans down the line. The new rules the Chinese government has recently imposed on policy banks suggest that Beijing believes their lending poses a risk to the broader Chinese economy.
 
 Meanwhile, risky ventures such as Sicomines carry a huge opportunity cost. While Go Out has funneled billions of dollars out of the Chinese economy, vast swaths of China remain underdeveloped. It’s true that much of the Chinese market is saturated. But investments in Tibet and Xinjiang would likely yield better returns than those in Congo and South Sudan. As a bonus, they would also contribute to China’s development and help ease some of its domestic tensions.
 
 Then there are the political risks that China is courting. After it was signed, the Sicomines agreement quickly became one of China’s most contentious ventures in Africa and generated massive backlash. Civil society actors quickly pointed out that the deal was negotiated in secrecy, entailed no competitive bidding, and sidelined much of the ministries that would normally negotiate such agreements in favor of a close friend of Kabila’s. International financial institutions worried that the deal would saddle Congo with crippling debt. Finally, many argued that China, to quench its thirst for natural resources, was taking advantage of one of the world’s poorest countries. In the 2011 election campaign, Congolese opposition politicians vowed to scrap the deal altogether if they rose to power. To most analysts, the Chinese parties of the agreement were making out like bandits.
 
 This is far from the case. Sicomines has invested more than $2 billion in infrastructure projects and in the mine itself, in addition to the $350 million bonus it disbursed. It is far from assured to get that money back. The mine finally produced copper in 2016 — far less than planned and long behind schedule. A change in government in Congo, which was due for 2016 according to its constitution, could sidetrack the deal completely. Sicomines’s fortunes could turn; minerals prices are in the midst of an upswing. But, for the past decade, the so-called deal of the century has been a major headache for China.

 President Trump’s new Africa program includes conditions on aid and a focus on trade and investment that is beneficial to the United States as well as the countries involved, Bolton said. He contrasted the approach with what he called China’s “predatory” trade, lending and practices in Africa, which he said is part of a “very well-thought-out” strategy to corner resources and military advantage.

 “It’s very important for the United States and the West as a whole to wake up,” Bolton said.
 
 “China uses bribes, opaque agreements and the strategic use of debt to hold states in Africa captive to Beijing’s wishes and demands,” Bolton said.
 
 “Its investment ventures are riddled with corruption, and do not meet the same environmental or ethical standards as U.S. development projects,” he said.

 The State Department and USAID spend $8.7 billion a year for development, security and food assistance in Africa. The programs are geared to reduce poverty and hunger, create jobs and improve education. U.S. businesses invested $50 billion in Africa in 2017, which the administration says is part of the U.S. commitment to Africa.
 
 The United States is trying to counter a massive flow of Chinese investment in the continent. An estimated 10,000 Chinese-owned firms operate in Africa, and China overtook the United States as Africa’s largest trading partner almost a decade ago. Beijing is building ports, railways, airports, hospitals, schools and stadiums across the continent. It has invested in African tobacco, sugar and rubber plantations.

 “We want our economic partners in the region to thrive, prosper and control their own destinies. In America’s economic dealings, we ask only for reciprocity, never for subservience,” Bolton said.
 
 Africa is the fastest-growing region in the world — its population is expected to double in the next three decades to 2.5 billion people, half of them under 24. Trump has not visited the continent as president, and drew criticism this year when he railed against immigration from African and other nations he referred to as “shithole countries.”

 “Everywhere I speak to an African audience, I emphasize we seek to do business not just in Africa, but with Africa,” Tibor Nagy, the assistant secretary for African Affairs at the State Department, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday.
 
 Trump’s approach to Africa will also focus on countering what Bolton called “radical Islamic terrorism” and violent conflict. He noted that U.S. forces are deployed in Africa to work against terrorist groups operating there but did not mention the ambush last year of a U.S. Special Forces unit in Niger. The incident was so chaotic that it took nearly two days to find the remains of one service member.
 
 The attack, launched by about 100 militants linked with the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, underscored the dangers of dispersing small teams of service members across vast areas in which the Pentagon does not have the same level of support available for ground forces as in a country such as Iraq or Afghanistan.

 In an investigation afterward, U.S. Africa Command determined that the terrorist group was able to mass such a force against U.S. and Nigerian soldiers because of numerous individual and institutional mistakes.
 
 The Pentagon has since begun to grapple with the idea of reducing the number of U.S. troops across the continent over the next three years. Defense officials have been vague about what that could entail but said that the number of troops will probably be reduced by about 10 percent. In recent years, there have been about 7,200 U.S. troops and Defense Department civilians assigned across the continent, according to the Pentagon.

China has mixed influence operations and economic aggression on a massive scale to try to exert undue influence over these countries’ political and economic systems.

 “The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) … is employing a unique set of tactics in the economic and information domains that undermines many developing countries’ democratic institutions and future prosperity as their dependence on China grows,” the report states. “These actions, in conjunction with China’s support for likeminded, illiberal partners and growing advocacy for its authoritarian model, have the potential to draw fragile democracies into China’s orbit and away from the United States and the democratic West.”
 
 The report is an in-depth look at how the CCP exerts influence in the countries most vulnerable: those whose level of democratic development makes them ripe for corruption and those where China’s authoritarian model is attractive to anti-democratic leaders. Beijing employs different tactics in each location, but patterns emerge.
 
 For example, the lack of transparency in Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, a multitrillion-dollar investment project, is a “feature” not a “bug,” the report states. By keeping contracts and terms opaque, China can both saddle poor countries with debt through predatory lending and protect the local elites who corruptly enable the schemes, the report explains.

 Beijing seeks to keep its influence intact even if the elites they corrupted go away or their lopsided deals are exposed. In both Malaysia and Sri Lanka, Beijing-friendly governments were thrown out, but their successors found they were still saddled with the Chinese projects and the Chinese debt.
 
 Perhaps the most troubling aspect of Beijing’s approach to developing countries is the Communist Party’s massive effort to influence their information space. China is buying up huge stakes in media companies in these countries, either directly or through proxies, especially Chinese diaspora media. Beijing also compels members of the Chinese diaspora, Chinese students and business executives abroad to work as “political agents” on behalf of Beijing, according to the report.
 
 In some countries, such as Cambodia or Serbia, the CCP doesn’t need to control the information space because autocratic leaders in those countries already do it for them. In return, Beijing offers autocrats extensive training on its government and development model while selling them the cyber and surveillance tools the CCP currently uses to repress its own citizens.

 “Beijing’s support for illiberal actors, the presentation of its model as a superior catalyst of industrial development, and its export of authoritarian tools and practices have the undeniable effect of eroding democratic norms in many countries,” the report states.
 
 Of course, all countries seek to exert influence, and China, with the second-largest economy in the world and growing fast, will naturally have a global role. But the fact that Beijing is using its increasing power to undermine democracy, free markets, rule of law and free speech in developing countries is not just a problem for the developing world.
 
 The IRI report argues that the United States and its partners must first educate their own citizens and then the people in these vulnerable countries about the reality of China’s investment and influence practices, and then help the countries bolster their democratic institutions to be more resilient to malign activities.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 There are people and institutions in developing countries that are trying to resist Beijing’s strategy, the report explains. For example, in Australia, leaders have passed laws and reformed policies to respond. But less developed countries need more help.
 
 “We need to actually focus our resources on making sure that the countries which are subject to Chinese government interference are aware of it,” said David Shullman, senior adviser to IRI. “If you want to counter Chinese Communist Party influence around the world, you have to support the people in these countries that are defending their own sovereignty.”
 
 The United States should not be in the business of trying to halt China’s rise or forcing countries to choose between the two powers. But at the same time, Beijing’s expansive efforts to undermine the global systems designed to preserve fair competition, rule of law and basic democratic freedoms can no longer be ignored.

In April, after the secretary of state blamed China for the crisis in Venezuela on a swing through Latin America, the Chinese envoy to Chile told a newspaper that Pompeo had gone mad.

 In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang asked Pompeo to “take a break.”
 
 “For quite some time, certain U.S. politicians have been touring the globe with the same script in their pockets: to smear China, starting fires and fanning the flames and sowing discord,” Lu told reporters.
 
 Given his public-facing position, Pompeo has attracted Beijing’s ire more than China hawks who work behind the scenes, such as economic adviser Peter Navarro or national security adviser John Bolton. Even Trump gets a relative pass in the state media compared with Pompeo, who is pilloried on a weekly, if not daily, basis.
 
 Vice President Pence is also viewed warily, Chinese foreign policy experts say, since he delivered a tough speech in October that was likened by many in Beijing to Winston Churchill’s 1946 “Iron Curtain” address.

 The Chinese say that after Beijing and Washington navigated their bilateral relationship pragmatically for decades, officials such as Pompeo represent an ideological turn in the United States that fundamentally opposes the Communist Party’s governance.
 
 “Mike Pompeo, along with Vice President Pence, are no doubt the two U.S. politicians that China hates the most at the moment,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. “Pompeo cemented his ‘China-hater’ status by making a series of imperious and hard-line criticisms of China from our Xinjiang and Hong Kong policies to the Tiananmen protests in 1989. Worse still, he attempted to use all those aspects to attack China’s political system.”
 
 Amid intensely personal pieces aimed at him this week, the Global Times newspaper referred to Pompeo’s tenure as the head of the CIA, mused on the prospect of his running for political office and suggested he was enriching himself through ties with the defense industry — all to build a portrait of a “malicious poisoner of global diplomacy.”

 The paper weighed the legacy of American diplomats such as Benjamin Franklin and Henry Kissinger. Pompeo should be considered more extreme in his opposition to China than the original “Cold War knight,” his Eisenhower-era predecessor John Foster Dulles, it concluded.
 
 Zhu Feng, a prominent scholar at Nanjing University whose long-term U.S. visa was revoked as he left Los Angeles recently, said the criticism reflected a broad “nervousness” in China — from the government in Beijing to the business world to ordinary Chinese — about the U.S. government’s shifting posture toward China.
 
 “In the U.S., Pompeo has been actively promoting hard-line China policies; on the international arena, he is also trying to fan hostility against Beijing as the trade war is turning into a bigger-scale tech war and a battle for global leadership,” Zhu said. “This, of course, has touched quite a few nerves in China.”

 Until the criticism of Pompeo turned personal in recent weeks, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesmen seldom referred to foreign officials by name as they offered their daily takes on international events.
 
 But on Thursday, spokesman Geng Shuang sounded almost weary as he responded — again — to Pompeo’s remarks in New Delhi, in which he warned Asian countries about the dangers of China’s infrastructure initiative.
 
 “I don’t know what has gotten into Mr. Pompeo,” Geng said. “He never forgets the Belt and Road Initiative, and he talks about it wherever he goes.”","['beijing', 'state', 'uschina', 'target', 'world', 'chinese', 'directs', 'pompeo', 'chinas', 'fury', 'president', 'china', 'foreign', 'fray', 'relations', 'global', 'mike']","{'Chile': 1, 'China': 20, 'Hong Kong': 1, 'India': 1, 'Japan': 1, 'Mali': 1, 'United States': 3}",,,,,

As a public service, I thought it would be a good idea to categorize them. BRI takes can be divided into three camps:
 
 CAMP 1: #OMGChina! The members of this camp believe that China can do no wrong. They therefore look at Belt and Road and see it as a brilliant coherent plan of quasi-coercive economic statecraft that ensnares all its participants into a Chinese web of influence.
 
 AD
 
 As it turns out, an awful lot of official U.S. actors fall into this camp. Both the 2017 National Security Strategy and 2018 National Defense Strategy reference China’s economic statecraft. The Defense Department’s 2018 report on China’s military power warns that the BRI “is intended to develop strong economic ties with other countries, shape their interests to align with China’s, and deter confrontation or criticism of China’s approach to sensitive issues.”
 
 AD
 
 It’s not just official actors. The Council on Foreign Relations describes BRI as “the most ambitious infrastructure investment effort in history” and “an unsettling extension of China’s rising power.” Most of the writers in this camp uses phrases like “debt trap diplomacy” and point to China’s newfound control over Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka as a result of that country’s failure to pay as the paradigmatic example.
 
 CAMP 2: BRI blowback. This camp, which consists of an awful lot of China watchers, points out the myriad ways in which China’s aggressive promotion of BRI has had negative feedback effects. They point to the way that China’s entry into South Asia triggered pushback from India. They highlight the fact that even countries dependent on Chinese foreign direct investment, such as Pakistan or Malaysia, have objected to BRI terms they found rather onerous. Other observers note that BRI investments also have triggered a spike in local protests against China. Still others note that the headline figures announced as BRI investments turn out to not mean much in the actual reality.
 
 AD
 
 This camp also does not think that BRI is the development of some radical alternative order. For them, the top-line figures of BRI funding are mostly a mirage. The branding of BRI has been too haphazard. The funding priorities have been at the mercy of Chinese domestic politics. This is not a recipe for creating alluring investments.
 
 AD
 
 CAMP 3: BRI as a learning curve. And now we arrive at the interesting possibility. This camp thinks of BRI the same way that Americans should think about all of China’s economic statecraft: Beijing is experimenting with how to convert its resources into influence. BRI is one of those experiments. With each failed experiment Beijing learns how to do economic statecraft better.
 
 Camp 2 is correct to point out all of the BRI screw-ups. What is interesting, however, is that Xi Jinping, the leader who coined BRI, is admitting this. According to the New York Times’s Jane Perlez, even Xi is willing to admit error: ""[Xi] stressed the importance of ‘high quality’ and ‘reasonably priced’ infrastructure as the way to help developing countries and said China would follow international rules on bidding and procurement for projects. In an apparent nod to past mistakes, Mr. Xi said: ‘Everything should be done in a transparent way, and we should have zero tolerance for corruption.’ ”
 
 AD
 
 Unsurprisingly, BRI is getting a new look on its sixth birthday, with the central government looking to control the brand better. If China is successful in its efforts, then Camp 3 will collapse into Camp 1. If not, Camp 2.

 “This was our Maginot Line. It would keep us safe, just as the French believed their series of steel and concrete forts would guard them against the German advance in 1940,” he wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age newspapers.
 
 “But their thinking failed catastrophically. The French had failed to appreciate the evolution of mobile warfare. Like the French, Australia has failed to see how mobile our authoritarian neighbor has become.”
 
 Hastie warned that it would be “immensely difficult” to uphold democratic convictions in the face of China’s growing might under President Xi Jinping. Without concerted action, he added, Australia’s sovereignty and freedoms would suffer and its “choices will be made for us.”
 
 AD
 
 Under Xi, China has built up military installations in the disputed South China Sea and increasingly challenged the forces of the United States and its allies in the region. Through its Belt and Road program, it has rolled out loans for infrastructure from the Pacific to Europe and Africa, leaving some nations with unsustainable debts.
 
 AD
 
 Closer to home, Xi has overseen an expansion of the state surveillance apparatus and has been putting pressure on Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province, through military exercises and efforts to cut off the democratic island’s diplomatic partners.
 
 Australia has a long-standing security alliance with the United States, but its top trading partner is China, whose appetite for raw materials such as coal and iron ore has helped drive Australia’s economic growth over the past quarter-century.

 China’s embassy in Canberra criticized Hastie’s remarks, accusing him of having a Cold War mentality and “ideological bias.”
 
 “It goes against the world trend of peace, cooperation and development,” the embassy said in a statement. “It is detrimental to China-Australian relations.”
 
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Thursday that Hastie was entitled to his views.

 Like other U.S. allies, Australia has been grappling with the risks and rewards of China’s rise. Australia has blocked Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network rollout and recently passed new laws designed to prevent foreign interference in its domestic politics.

 At the same time, the United States has been pressing Australia to take bolder action in countering China’s growing power in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia, though, has said that it would not host U.S. missile bases.

 “I make this pledge to you: The government of Japan will put forth every possible effort so that the power of Japanese private investment, of $20 billion in three years, should in the years to come be surpassed anew from one day to the next,” he said. “We will do whatever it takes to assist the advancement of Japanese companies into Africa.”
 
 AD
 
 To some extent, Japan is hoping to exploit a growing sense in Africa that putting all of one’s eggs in Beijing’s basket is not entirely wise.
 
 Rather than competing directly, it has tried to differentiate itself from China by stressing the quality of the infrastructure it can build in Africa.
 
 As concerns rise about Chinese state-to-state lending pushing African countries further into debt, Japan has stressed financial sustainability and private-sector partnerships that don’t raise government borrowing.
 
 AD
 
 Where China brings its own workers across to build infrastructure, Japan says it employs locals and transfers technology to Africa, just as it has done across Asia.
 
 That’s the theory. The problem in practice is that poor countries with huge infrastructure deficits often do not feel they can afford to pay for quality, while Japanese corporations are not exactly bursting with enthusiasm for Africa, officials admit.
 
 AD
 
 Corporate Japan — notoriously cautious in its decision-making — sees significant risks and relatively unattractive returns in Africa’s small and often fragmented markets, said Razia Khan, chief Africa economist for Standard Chartered Bank.
 
 AD
 
 Japan’s trade with Africa, at $17 billion in 2018, is half what it was in 2008 and a fraction of China’s more than $200 billion, official figures show.
 
 “It’s obvious with Japan’s declining budgets they don’t have the ODA [overseas development assistance] capacity to just be tossing out money, so they went to these public-private partnerships,” said J. Berkshire Miller, a senior visiting fellow with the Japan Institute of International Affairs. “But the key question is whether the private sector can sustain this, and I think that’s challenging.”
 
 To address that challenge, Abe pledged “limitless support” for investment, innovation, enterprise and entre­pre­neur­ship — by partnering with local financial institutions to establish a new trade insurance plan, for example.

 He highlighted a Japanese satellite monitoring crop harvest and water resources in Rwanda, a Japanese business executive employing single mothers and former child soldiers to make colorful bags in Uganda, and a Japanese company laying the first undersea cable connecting Angola with Brazil.
 
 He also highlighted Japan’s contribution to supporting health care and education in Africa, as well as cleaning cities of waste and clearing land of mines, while also announcing a project to train police officers, judges and prosecutors.
 
 In return, Abe wants African support for an old idea and a new one.
 
 The old one is reform of the United Nations Security Council to allow more permanent members, “a common cause for Africa and Japan that still awaits a resolution,” he said.
 
 AD
 
 The new one is support for Japan’s idea of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific, uniting the region behind the principles of free trade and freedom of navigation, the rule of law, and the market economy, and meant partly as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
 
 AD
 
 Abe said he wanted to work with the continent “to safeguard the Indo-Pacific, which connects Africa and Japan, with great care, as an international public good permeated by the rule of law.”
 
 Miller said Japan was being careful not to frame the Indo-Pacific idea as a direct challenge to China, rebranding it as a “vision” rather than a “strategy,” and talking more about quality infrastructure than maritime security. That’s partly because it realizes African states do not want to be forced to choose between Japan and China, he said.
 
 AD
 
 Abe spoke at the opening of the seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development, known as TICAD, an event held every three years, and on this occasion staged in the port city of Yokohama, just south of the capital.
 
 Khan says African nations welcome the idea of Japanese investment and see the advantage of not being “too reliant on one economic partner” — in other words, China.
 
 AD
 
 “So the hope is that this time is different, that alongside yet another TICAD, we are going to get more meaningful follow-through on the back of it,” Khan said.
 
 “But it is happening at a time of considerable uncertainty for the global economy.

 But not everyone is convinced that Belt and Road is such a great plan — either for China or the countries in which it’s investing. And with Malaysia announcing Tuesday that it has shelved two major infrastructure projects being built by Chinese companies because of high costs, many more leaders around the world may be wondering whether Chinese investment is a good deal.
 
 It may be simpler to start with a more basic question: What is the Belt and Road? Given the vague way that Beijing has described the program, it’s hard to find an answer. Many have found it easier to think of the initiative in terms of its scale and ambition: Beijing has called it the “project of the century,” while others have compared it to the Marshall Plan, Washington’s stimulus package for a war-ravaged Europe (though the Belt and Road is many times bigger).
 
 It’s not a single thing, but rather a catchall term for investments in more than 60 countries around the world. The purported aim of that network is to better connect China with its trading partners. In practice, it usually involves getting foreign countries to take out large loans from China to build vast infrastructure projects, which are then typically built by Chinese companies.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 All of that is quite obviously in China’s interests. In the short term, it’s able to use some of its excess industrial capacity abroad as its own economy slows. In the longer term, it could help internationalize Chinese companies and give Beijing a critical role in how global trade operates.
 
 There’s also a powerful political motive: A Pentagon report released last week said China was trying to “develop strong economic ties with other countries, shape their interests to align with China’s, and deter confrontation or criticism of China’s approach to sensitive issues.”
 
 Even so, many foreign partners were eager to sign up for the Belt and Road — largely because the loans tend to come with far fewer restrictions than those from Western countries.
 
 AD
 
 But Malaysia’s decision shows how the plan can come apart. For one thing, Belt and Road projects have sometimes made no economic sense. In Sri Lanka, China poured money into an airport designed to handle 1 million passengers a year. Now it has been dubbed the world’s emptiest international airport. “Business is so slow that the airport has made more money from renting out the unused cargo terminals for rice storage than from flight-related activities,” wrote Bangkok-based writer Brook Larmer.
 
 AD
 
 Another Belt and Road project in Sri Lanka, a deepwater port, is now in the hands of a state-owned Chinese company on a 99-year lease after it failed to attract enough business to make its loan payments. This could swell into a bigger problem: A study released by the Center for Global Development in March suggested that Djibouti, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Maldives, Mongolia, Montenegro, Pakistan and Tajikistan would also struggle to repay Chinese Belt and Road loans.
 
 To critics, this is a feature of China’s plan, not a bug. China, they say, is planning to bully smaller countries with “debt diplomacy” — and some even go further, suggesting that perhaps the plan is for China’s military to make use of all these belts and roads one day in the future. (It should be noted, however, that debt-fueled projects that make no commercial sense can be carried out within China, as well.)

 What’s certainly clear is that the ambiguity of the Belt and Road is a major concern for its current and prospective participants. Beijing doesn’t release a central list of projects or the funding they’ve been given, and key parts of the process — such as bidding on contracts — are generally kept opaque. In Malaysia, where the deals were cut under former prime minister Najib Razak, officials now say they were made to bail out a Malaysian state investment fund plagued by graft. Najib left office in May and was arrested in July on corruption-related charges.
 
 AD
 
 The Belt and Road still has its admirers. Experts have pointed toward some projects, such as an oil pipeline in Myanmar and rail networks in Kenya, that seem to be worthy capital investments. And countries will certainly come knocking on Beijing’s door as long as there’s easy money to be had. Turkey, in the middle of an economic downturn and a dispute with Washington, may be next.
 
 But Malaysia’s high-profile decision to back out of projects shows how quickly the tide can turn against China’s vision. Indeed, to many, Beijing’s dream of a new future is starting to look uncomfortably like nightmares of the past. “We do not want a situation where there is a new version of colonialism happening because poor countries are unable to compete with rich countries,” Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said at a Monday news conference in Beijing.
 
 AD
 
 The discontent may come from within China, too. A string of defaults on Belt and Road loans could cause Beijing fiscal problems, and risky loans to foreign countries are now a tougher sell for President Xi Jinping as the domestic economy faces its own issues. If a serious downturn hits while China is showering cash on projects abroad, Bloomberg News’s Shuli Ren warns, “you can expect a revolt.”

 At least seven countries have run into trouble with Belt and Road projects or had a rethink, often after a popular backlash, change of government or both. Complaints include corruption, padded contracts, heavy debt loads, environmental damage and a reliance on imported Chinese labor over local hires. Some examples:
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 • Sri Lanka borrowed heavily to build a new port, couldn’t repay the loans, and then gave a state-owned Chinese company a 99-year lease in exchange for debt relief. The port has little business now but provides China a strategic berth along key shipping lanes.
 
 • Projects along the $62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor have been slimmed down due to Pakistan’s long-running debt problems.
 
 • Myanmar drastically scaled back a port deal struck under its previous military regime, to $1.3 billion from $7.5 billion.
 
 • A new Malaysian government canceled $3 billion worth of pipelines and renegotiated a rail project in 2019, cutting that one’s cost by a third to $11 billion.
 
 AD
 
 • Leaders in the Maldives are seeking debt relief amid allegations of large-scale graft connected to BRI projects under the previous government.
 
 AD
 
 • In June 2019 a court in Kenya halted construction of a Chinese-backed power plant on Lamu island, a major tourist destination, and ordered a new environmental-impact assessment.
 
 2. What’s changing?
 
 At a high-profile forum in April 2019, Xi signaled that the Chinese government would exert more control over BRI projects and tighten oversight. Rather than boasting about the initiative’s growth, as he did at the previous forum in 2017, he focused on steps China is taking to clean up its image, urging “higher quality” and “greener” projects and vowing “zero tolerance” for corruption. State-owned-enterprises, by far the biggest investors in BRI projects, are being told to beef up auditing and increase supervision for their overseas units and personnel. The government has been drafting rules for use of the BRI label to try to better protect its reputation. And the Communist Party’s propaganda machine has turned down the volume. The People’s Daily, a party mouthpiece, launched two new columns and a special edition in the run-up to the first BRI forum. One government official described that campaign as having been too aggressive. Around the 2019 forum, the newspaper ran only about 10 articles in its regular pages.
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 3. Is China serious about change?
 
 Signs of a more cautious approach have emerged -- at least around its debt exposure. China has withheld some $4.9 billion in new loans for a major rail project it had been building in eastern Africa. The line was supposed to run from the Kenyan port city of Mombasa to Uganda and beyond, but only the stretch from the coast to Nairobi is done. China balked at funding the extension amid concerns that Kenya was at risk of debt distress. Revenue from the railway is supposed to repay the initial $3.6 billion loan, but critics say it won’t turn a profit for a long time. RWR Advisory Group, a Washington-based consulting firm, reported that the Export Import Bank of China backed out of providing financing for a giant solar project due to the Zimbabwean government’s legacy debts.
 
 4. Is the reboot convincing anyone?
 
 AD
 
 AD
 
 Italy in 2019 became the first Group of Seven country to sign a memorandum to join the BRI, despite pressure from many of its European Union partners and the U.S., providing a public relations coup for Beijing. After six years of wrangling, Russia quietly approved its first project designed specifically for the BRI: a toll road linking China’s western neighbor Kazakhstan with Belarus, which borders Poland and two other EU members. The second BRI forum attracted about three dozen world leaders, more than the first. Still, Asian powerhouses Japan and South Korea stayed away, as did the U.S. and the three biggest European economies: Germany, the U.K. and France.
 
 5. What else is China trying?
 
 It’s trying to woo skeptics with a framework dubbed third-party market cooperation, which is basically an agreement to consider working together on specific infrastructure projects without actually endorsing the BRI. China hopes such partnerships will give it access to Western technology and expertise, reduce financial risks and dispel allegations that China is just trying to expand its influence. Japan, Australia, France, Singapore, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria have signed the third-party pacts. But apparently not much has come from it. A 2018 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that of all the contractors participating in Chinese-funded infrastructure projects, 89% were Chinese companies, 7.6% local and just 3.4% foreign, “third-party” companies. Impediments to the participation of multinational companies include the absence of open tenders, standardized contracts, transparent procurement rules and anti-corruption safeguards.

 AD
 
 6. What’s the bigger picture?
 
 Compared to 2013 when the BRI was first introduced, China is facing a more difficult economic environment. Its growth has slowed to the weakest pace since at least 1992. Chinese policy makers are leaning toward more spending on domestic infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy, which can restrict the funds available for lending abroad. At the same time, geopolitical uncertainties are on the rise, most notably persistent tensions over trade and other issues with the U.S. But China has other reasons for pressing ahead that remain strong, including a desire to better integrate and develop its remote western provinces, and to diversify routes for energy imports.
 
 7. How much has been spent?
 
 AD
 
 It’s difficult to pinpoint, even for authorities in Beijing. Chinese companies had directly invested more than $80 billion in Belt and Road countries through the end of 2018, according to an official tally. But that doesn’t include money from China’s policy banks and other state-owned institutions such as the Silk Road Fund, which focuses on equity investments, or from other partners. The World Bank in 2019 counted $575 billion worth of BRI investments, most of which were still in the construction or planning phase. Almost half the total was in energy and a quarter in transport.

 When President Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June, national security adviser John Bolton opted to go ahead with a preplanned trip to Ulaanbaatar rather than accompany him. Weeks later, Mongolian President Khaltmaa Battulga landed in Washington for an official visit to the White House.

 But it’s Mongolia’s strategic location — nestled between China and Russia — that makes it a natural partner for Washington. In the State Department’s 2019 budget, it described U.S. assistance priorities in Mongolia as ensuring “the United States remains a preferred partner over geographical neighbors Russia and China,” the AP reported.
 
 And Mongolia has long “called the U.S. their third neighbor,” said Mike Green, a former George W. Bush administration official and senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The East Asian country looks “to the U.S. and U.S. allies like Japan and Korea to help them maintain economic growth and independence.""

 The two countries already cooperate militarily: U.S. troops participate in cold weather training in Mongolia, and Mongolian troops are on the ground in Afghanistan.

 As China expands its massive development project, the Belt and Road Initiative, the United States and Mongolia see each other as necessary partners to counter Chinese influence there and across the region. Because of its location, about 90 percent of Mongolia’s trade passes through China. The White House said in July that Trump’s meeting with Battulga, a populist businessman and former world martial arts champion, was intended to find ways to expand how and where Mongolia trades.
 
 “The Chinese are trying to do in Mongolia what they’re trying to do everywhere else in Asia, which is use a combination of economic incentives, intimidation and interference to pull Mongolia into its strategic orbit,” Green said. “It is a front-line state in the strategic competition with China and one that really likes the U.S.”

 Delighted to be in Ulaanbaatar & looking forward to meeting with officials to find ways to harness Mongolia’s capabilities in support of our shared economic & security objectives.

 Battulga’s administration has even offered to host a meeting between Trump and Kim, and the White House said in June that the two countries “have agreed that their relationship has reached the level of a ‘strategic partnership.’ ”

 Soon after Esper landed in Ulaanbaatar this week, officials there presented him with a gift to thank him for his visit: a 7-year-old horse with a thick, caramel-colored mane. Esper named the horse Marshall, after Gen. George Marshall, who served as defense secretary under President Harry S. Truman.
 
 “He’s happy,” Esper said as he patted his new horse. “He likes his name.”
 
 Esper’s horse is the second equine Mongolia has recently given to an affiliate of Trump, first presenting one to Trump’s 13-year-old son, Barron, last month. He named his Victory. Following tradition, both horses will be kept in Mongolia.

 Horses have long been symbols of diplomacy in Mongolia.
 
 In 2005, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was given a horse that he named Montana for his wife’s home state. In 2014, Chuck Hagel, another defense secretary, named his Shamrock after his high school mascot. President George W. Bush, the only sitting U.S. president to visit Mongolia, requested to not be given a horse, but he did taste mare milk on his visit.

 Many of China's Belt and Road projects run through Xinjiang Province, home to the Muslim-minority Uighurs who live in intense security. Many sense Belt and Road and Xinjiang's problems are connected.
 
 STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
 
 We're here on a day when China is showing off to the world. President Xi Jinping welcomed foreign leaders to the Belt and Road Forum. In a vast convention center, he's promoting infrastructure linking China with much of the world.
 
 The walls here are covered with immense photographs of Chinese landscapes, Chinese pagodas, and immense, modern-day construction projects.
 
 The pictures of bridges and skyscrapers advertise Chinese skill at building. Now let's discuss something not pictured. Many of China's new roads, railways, and pipelines point westward toward Pakistan and Central Asia. To get there, they passed through a province where China has imposed some of its harshest security measures. Many ethnic Uighurs have been sent to camps. Infrastructure meant to open the world passes through an area that is emphatically closed. NPR's Rob Schmitz has been visiting the province for years. So, Rob, what is it like to travel to this really remote province?
 
 ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Well, Xinjiang is nearly the size of Alaska. It is huge - it's the farthest place on Earth from an ocean. It's home to one of the largest deserts in the world. It's got snow-capped mountains, thousands of glaciers. And underneath all of that, you've got mineral and fossil fuel deposits. And that's why China's government is interested in the development of the area.
 
 The region's been occupied for millennia by a variety of Central Asian ethnicities, most recently dominated by the Uighur people. And just 75 years ago, Uighurs made up 75% of Shinjuku's population. Now they make up less than half. And that gets to the nature of the problems there. Uighurs, who are predominantly Muslim and whose culture and language have more in common with Central Asian cultures than Chinese culture, have become the minority. Beijing sent millions of Han Chinese there to fortify control over the region. And this influx of Han Chinese has led to tensions and violence between two very different ethnic groups.
 
 INSKEEP: Well, how intense has the security been in recent years as Chinese authorities have played up fears of terrorism?
 
 SCHMITZ: Well, in the past five years, it's developed a security presence that's sort of on par with a place like North Korea. In Xinjiang cities, cameras are everywhere. You can never really escape them. Police stations are a few hundred feet apart from each other. Police constantly check IDs and routinely ask people to open their phones, so they can check photos, messages. The government has its own app that's used to spy on people's personal data. And police at these checkpoints force people to download that.
 
 In 2017, before we knew the government was about to detain hundreds of thousands of people, I spoke to local residents about what all of this meant for their daily lives. One ethnic Kazakh businessman who, for his own safety, did not give me his name, told me he used to regularly travel outside of China on business, but not anymore.
 
 UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Through interpreter) The police have now taken our passports from us. We can't travel, so it's impossible to do business or make money. Even if they do give your passport back to you, when you come back from a foreign trip, police will interrogate you about what you did there. It's troublesome. And it makes me not want to leave anymore.
 
 INSKEEP: So that's the situation that has evolved in Xinjiang province, Rob, but what does that have to do with the Belt and Road project?
 
 SCHMITZ: Well, the success of the Belt and Road project hinges on a stable and prosperous Xinjiang. China will need that in order to convince foreign companies to come and invest there and in order for its own economy to do well.
 
 INSKEEP: And now, as I understand it, the government has invited you on a kind of tour of these reeducation or detainment camps.
 
 SCHMITZ: Yeah, that's right. China's government cares very much how the outside world sees this issue. And this trip is part of an effort to justify its actions. It should be a pretty interesting trip.
 
 INSKEEP: That was NPR's Rob Schmitz a couple of days ago. Now, since then, he has joined a Chinese government-led tour of camps for Uighurs in far western China. This is an exceptionally rare look inside, although we must note Rob is only able to see what the government shows him and then apply his own knowledge of the story to what he's seeing. Rob is in Kashgar, which is in far western China, and an important Belt and Road city, by the way. Rob, what have you seen today?
 
 SCHMITZ: Well, Steve, our government-led group just finished a tour of what's known as the Kashgar City Vocational Education and Training Center. This is one of a network of internment camps that are in Xinjiang and that we've been reporting on now for about a year. This one is outside the city of Kashgar. It holds 1,500 people between the age of 20 and 40. And what was known as the principal gave us a tour of all of the classes that are offered to the people that are interred there. And some of them were tourism classes, classes on how to make clothes. I saw folks get trained to be electricians. One was a culture class where they were learning singing and dancing.
 
 What was interesting is that when we asked the principal - why are people here? - he told us that everyone here has been infected with extremist thought. One woman that I met there - her name is Iagulli Abd al-Rahman (ph) - she's 30 years old. She's been at this facility for several months. She has two children, 9 and 7 years old, at home. And her husband is at home, taking care of the children. She gets to go back on the weekends, but she has to spend all of her weeks at this training camp. I asked her why she was there. And here's what she said.
 
 IAGULLI ABD AL-RAHMAN: (Foreign language spoken.)
 
 SCHMITZ: And, Steve, she's saying here that her thoughts are extremely serious in their violation of - basically, they're very extremist thoughts that she had. And when I asked a follow-up question about - what kind of thoughts were those? - she said that there was an incident where she did not allow her two children to take part in a cultural event where they were asking the children to sing and dance Uighur songs. These are typical songs that many especially Han Chinese tourists like to see when they come to these types of areas. And she didn't allow her children to take part in that.
 
 INSKEEP: So people are suspected of extremism for what sounds like rather minor violations and placed in these camps. But is this a course of study, and then they're released? Is this a prison? What is it?
 
 SCHMITZ: When I asked the students, for example - how long will you be here? - many of them didn't know. They just said, well, we have to keep studying. We're not sure when we - they use the word graduate. We're just going to purify our thoughts to make sure that we don't have any more extremist thoughts in our head. Judging from the outside, it's got an enormous, 15-foot fence around it. When you get inside, there are seven rather large, beige buildings. All of the windows have wrought-iron bars or fencing around it so that you can't easily get out.
 
 INSKEEP: Well, how does this tour compare, Rob, with what you've learned about the camps in other ways that you've been able to report on them?
 
 SCHMITZ: Well, this is starkly different from the people that I have spoke to who have been inside these camps. Many of them told me that they were tortured, but that is something that I also did not see today. But obviously, this was a very choreographed tour.
 
 INSKEEP: NPR's Rob Schmitz is in the farthest western part of China, where he's been getting a government-led look inside internment camps for Uighurs. Rob, thanks so much.
 
 SCHMITZ: Thanks, Steve.

 Chinese President Xi Jinping is hosting world leaders in a forum on China's Belt and Road Initiative. Also, a look at a district that voted for Obama and then Trump.
 
 STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
 
 I'm here with an NPR team in Beijing because China is showcasing its global ambitions today, Rachel. President Xi Jinping is hosting a forum for more than 30 leaders of other nations, from the president of the Philippines to Russia's Vladimir Putin. It's a forum supporting Xi's Belt and Road Initiative, infrastructure projects across Asia to Europe and to Africa, even beyond. President Xi greeted all the leaders in a glass-walled convention center that is many blocks long.
 
 (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
 
 PRESIDENT XI JINPING: (Speaking Chinese).
 
 INSKEEP: ""We need to protect the earth where we all live,"" he said. And he promised projects that are both good for the environment and free of corruption.
 
 RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
 
 But what about that, Steve? Some tension in that quote because aren't a lot of the Chinese projects accused of not being good for the environment or free from corruption?
 
 INSKEEP: Yeah, absolutely. I said that President Xi is promoting Belt and Road, but I might just as easily say defend Belt and Road. It is clear that Chinese officials know that the United States and some allies are increasingly skeptical of what China is up to, how polluting are some of these projects - coal-fired power plants, for example. And also, is China seeking power as well as money and investment here?
 
 MARTIN: Right, OK, so tell us more. What is China up to?
 
 INSKEEP: Well, China will say they just want to better connect the world, and they're reaching back to China's tradition of trade along the Silk Road, which went from China to Europe in - in ancient times and that they want to increase trade. Now they talk about cooperating with developing nations. Economists and experts on China say this country, whose economy has grown so massively, is dealing with what they call overcapacity. They are really able to build infrastructure. There are massive airports, massive train stations, massive highways in this country. And in some cases, in some places, they're too big. And there are too many of them.
 
 So where do you put all those people to work building even more infrastructure? You send them overseas, maybe. The United States looks at all of this, though, and sees China loaning money to developing nations, sometimes on bad terms for bad projects, and increasing its influence there as it gains more and more control and more and more leverage over various developing nations.
 
 MARTIN: So what does China say to that allegation, that building all this infrastructure in all these places is just a power play?
 
 INSKEEP: Well, they insist that they're really all about cooperation and partnerships. President Xi today, in a speech to the other world leaders who came to attend, suggested that if other nations want to help finance these projects, they can. But in any case, China seems determined to lay out a lot of money. And we should remember, Rachel, it's money. And developing nations want it.
 
 MARTIN: Right. So these projects, especially the ones that are to be built, are these really going to be any greener or less corrupt?
 
 INSKEEP: Well, the language has certainly gotten greener. It's been noted by some that the last time there was a big forum, a couple of years ago, to discuss Belt and Road, the word green was not used a lot. It's being used constantly here this week. But really, the projects that are being built mirror China's own economy. Let's just talk about energy projects for a moment. China does a lot of wind power. China does a lot of solar panels. This is something they're very proud of doing, and they're proud of spreading those kinds of projects overseas when they're developing things.
 
 But China also gets most of its energy from coal-fired power plants, which affect climate change, of course. And it's exporting those projects as well. And as a matter of fact, just the other day yet another Chinese-built coal plant opened in Pakistan. That's a place that needs a lot of electricity for sure. There are a lot of blackouts in Pakistan. But it is a coal-fired power plant. And that's what China knows how to do. And they're doing things that they know how to do.
 
 MARTIN: Steve Inskeep, reporting from Beijing, China. Steve, thanks.
 
 INSKEEP: Glad to do it.

 MARTIN: What do Americans care about most? It's the question that probably should be at the center of political life in the United States. And it's a key question to answer if you're a politician trying to decide what to focus on.
 
 INSKEEP: NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell spent some time with Democratic Congresswoman Cheri Bustos in her Illinois district, a so-called pivot district, a swing district which went for both President Obama and for President Trump.
 
 MARTIN: Kelsey's in the studio with me. Good morning, Kelsey.
 
 KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Good morning.
 
 MARTIN: Why this particular district?
 
 SNELL: Well, it is in northwest Illinois, kind of bordering Iowa, actually. And Cheri Bustos is an interesting character because she is going to be running the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for 2020. So she is in charge of making sure that Democrats get reelected in the House. And a big part of her strategy is defending districts like the 40 freshmen who beat Republicans in the last election. And she wants to find a way to make sure that they can speak to voters in the way that keeps them with the Democratic Party and keeps them from fleeing back to the Republicans they voted for before.
 
 MARTIN: Right, to secure those gains and expand them. So what'd you see on your trip? What are folks talking about there?
 
 SNELL: Well, we started the day in Moline, Ill., which is the headquarters of John Deere tractors. Now, this is...
 
 MARTIN: Did you ride a tractor?
 
 SNELL: I didn't get to ride a tractor, unfortunately.
 
 MARTIN: Oh, Kelsey.
 
 SNELL: (Laughter).
 
 MARTIN: Next time.
 
 SNELL: We - it also has a lot of rail and industry there. And we went to a bunch of small towns and just kind of - it's part of her regular routine to ask voters what she should be talking about when she goes back to Washington. You know, what none of them talked about was the special counsel, Robert Mueller, or the impeachment of President Trump. One by one, they went up to her and asked her about - questions about things like health care. And they wanted to know about whether or not there was going to be a new rail stop added nearby. And they talked about local issues.
 
 So I went up, and I followed up with a number of them. And I asked, why didn't you, if you had this opportunity to talk to the person who represents you in Washington, ask about these big national issues? It's only been about a week since we saw the report from Robert Mueller. And I talked to Deirdre Mannon (ph), who runs a paratransit service that brings people who are disabled to their appointments and, you know, around town in Galesburg, Ill. And this is what she told me.
 
 DEIRDRE MANNON: This is more important than what she says about impeachment - most definitely - because she's one vote when she's talking impeachment.
 
 MARTIN: Such a lesson - right? - in how Washington perceives these big national questions about our democracy, the role of rule of law when, actually, it's just the same kitchen table issues that have motivated voters since the beginning of time.
 
 SNELL: Right. I mean, and at some level it feels a little bit like we're a broken record. We've been saying for a long time that was what won Democrats the House in 2018, was talking about health care. But there was some question about whether or not things would change after the Mueller investigation started to wrap up. And it seems like so far, that's not what's happening. I asked Bustos about it. And she predicted that this was what would happen because she says this is what she hears every day.
 
 CHERI BUSTOS: These are the kind of things that they talk about on a day-to-day basis. They are not obsessed about what Donald Trump is doing day in and day out.
 
 SNELL: And her advice to people running in these types of districts is to stick to the issues that got you elected. Don't start talking about the big national issues when your voters really care about, you know, making sure that their needs are served.
 
 MARTIN: Which is what Nancy Pelosi has said as well...
 
 SNELL: Yeah.
 
 MARTIN: ...Trying to temper expectations of some Democrats.
 
 SNELL: Shaping up to be the strategy for 2020.
 
 MARTIN: All right, NPR's Kelsey Snell. Kelsey, we appreciate it.
 
 SNELL: Thanks.
 
 (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
 
 MARTIN: It is all over.
 
 INSKEEP: And I have some language here, Rachel, that I feel I should be reading like a movie announcer. So let me try this.
 
 MARTIN: Go for it, Steve.
 
 INSKEEP: (Imitating movie announcer) After 11 years, 22 films and more heroes and villains than you can shake a magic hammer at, the current iteration of the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to a climactic close this weekend with ""Avengers: Endgame.""
 
 (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""AVENGERS: ENDGAME"")
 
 ROBERT DOWNEY JR: (As Tony Stark) I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one.
 
 MARTIN: That was pretty good. You pulled it off. You pulled it off.
 
 INSKEEP: Thank you very much. Thank you.
 
 MARTIN: OK, I'm joined now in our studios by NPR's Glen Weldon. It is always a good day when Glen Weldon is in our studios to talk superheroes.
 
 GLEN WELDON, BYLINE: Oh, thanks, Rachel.
 
 MARTIN: So we're going to try to keep this conversation as spoiler-free as possible, right?
 
 WELDON: Yeah, I don't want people coming after me. Let's try.
 
 MARTIN: No, no, all right. So let's do it. This is a big movie for all kinds of reasons, including the fact that it is just a really long movie, right?
 
 WELDON: Three hours and two minutes.
 
 MARTIN: Three hours and change. Why?
 
 WELDON: (Laughter) Well...
 
 MARTIN: Why is it that long?
 
 WELDON: OK, it's the culmination of a really long story. You've got a lot of characters to address. You've got a lot of storylines to wrap up. And some of those storylines have been going on for 11 years now. That said, let's do some service journalism here.
 
 MARTIN: Please.
 
 WELDON: It's probably best to manage a couple of things going to this film - one, your expectations and, two, your fluid intake because I went into this thing parched. And I was grateful for it because once this thing starts going, there's not a lot of places to duck out.
 
 MARTIN: There's not a bathroom break.
 
 WELDON: So go in chapped.
 
 MARTIN: (Laughter). OK, is this a movie for the casual observer of the ""Avengers"" series - say - say, like me, who's never engaged in these movies, but maybe, hey - maybe I want to check this one out?
 
 WELDON: It depends on how casual because if you don't know these characters, it will mean precisely nothing to you because this is what happened at the end of the last film, in ""Avengers: Infinity War."" You had this massive purple intergalactic despot named Thanos, who turned exactly half the population of the entire universe into dust...
 
 MARTIN: Whoa.
 
 WELDON: ...With a snap of his fingers, right?
 
 MARTIN: Wow.
 
 WELDON: That's the big event. Now, Marvel wants us to call that the decimation. But, Rachel, you and I are not going to do that because we know that words have meanings.
 
 MARTIN: Yes, they do.
 
 WELDON: Decimation means one-tenth. You reduce the population by one-tenth.
 
 MARTIN: Obviously.
 
 WELDON: So we will call it - you and I - the Snapture (ph). And so when we meet the - the remaining Avengers coming into this film, they've just had a massive loss. And they are kind of cycling through different Kubler-Ross stages of grief. Some of them despair, rage, depression - all of it.
 
 MARTIN: OK, that sounds very emotive.
 
 WELDON: Yeah.
 
 MARTIN: But it doesn't really sound very, like, violent or like a big slug fest.
 
 WELDON: Well, that's the thing. For the first two hours of this film, it is intensely intimate and even...
 
 MARTIN: It's about feelings.
 
 WELDON: ...Somber - right, right - because, again, it's about grief. Now, there are plenty of very funny moments in those first two hours, from Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Mark Ruffalo's Hulk, who both look a bit different than the last time we saw them...
 
 MARTIN: OK.
 
 WELDON: And Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, who was just as goofy and ever - as ever he was. And now, it cannot possibly be considered a spoiler to say that there is a big climactic battle here. And when it comes, it is some of the most thrilling superhero cinema I have ever seen.
 
 MARTIN: Whoa.
 
 WELDON: And, Rachel, I have seen a lot.
 
 MARTIN: You have seen a lot.
 
 WELDON: Yeah - because it's all based on how familiar we are - at least people like me are - with these characters. That's - it's all grounded in that affection. So if you see it, see it with a crowd - for the cheers, for the boos, for the sniffles.
 
 MARTIN: Oh, sniffles.
 
 WELDON: Yeah.
 
 MARTIN: There's crying.
 
 WELDON: I saw it at a press screening, and jaded - jaded jerks like me were sniffling.
 
 MARTIN: Crying. OK, box office - really, biggest ever?
 
 WELDON: Probably, yeah - I mean, the last one made $258 million in its opening weekend, just - just, you know, here in the States. This one internationally could go, some analysts are saying, as big as a billion worldwide in its opening weekend.
 
 MARTIN: You said you were sniffling during this. Is that because it - there are no movies - there are no more of these movies?
 
 WELDON: The next ""Spider-Man"" film is six weeks away. So I think we're good.
 
 MARTIN: All right, you're OK. You're OK. Who's counting? Glen Weldon is an editor on the NPR Arts Desk and a panelist on NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour. Glen, thank you so much.
 
 WELDON: Thank you.

 Much is expected of Karakoram Highway, which curls through the tall mountain ranges of northern Pakistan, reaching western China. Both countries are renovating it, seeing its potential as a trade route. Pakistan also views it as a way to consolidate control over territories contested with India.
 
 But some of the 500-mile route is barely a two-way road, carved out of the rock face that slopes sharply into valleys below. It is battered by rockfall, floods and earthquakes. A landslide in 2010 blocked a river and drowned about 14 miles of the road. In heavy snowfalls, the road all but shuts down.
 
 Enlarge this image toggle caption Diaa Hadid /NPR Diaa Hadid /NPR
 
 The riskiest part is the last stretch to China. ""We can actually call this part of the road as a museum of geohazards,"" says Sarfraz Ali, a geologist who studies the impact of climate change on the highway at Pakistan's National University of Sciences and Technology.
 
 The Karakoram Highway, named for the spindly mountain range it traverses, was a major feat when it was built in the 1950s to 1970s. Now, the Chinese government has invested about $2 billion to rebuild a nearly 160-mile stretch of highway to replace the old Karakoram road between the Pakistani towns of Havelian and Raikot. The final stretch is expected to be completed in March.
 
 The revamp is a key project of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, in which China plans to invest over $60 billion in energy and transport in Pakistan. CPEC, part of China's global Belt and Road Initiative, has stirred controversy because neither country has offered clarity on the terms of the money or how much of it is loans.

 The Karakoram is open to much of the public, but foreign journalists are required to get Pakistani military permission to visit its far-northern stretches. When NPR recently gained access, its reporters found a road that has transformed communities along the way.
 
 These days, vehicles cruise on the new highway north of Islamabad until they're diverted onto the old route, passing rivers and ancient Buddhist monuments, and snarling hectic markets. At night, some stretches are lit by the fluorescent light of flophouses and chai stalls frequented by truck drivers.
 
 At the Jehangir Khan Hotel, owner Abdullah Zadran, 28, says he would go out of business because the Chinese were rebuilding this section of the road as a multilane highway outside of town.
 
 Enlarge this image toggle caption Diaa Hadid/NPR Diaa Hadid/NPR
 
 Waiter Abdul Ghafour, 30, nods in agreement. ""My owner won't keep me,"" he says, worried about losing his $4-a-day wage.
 
 He serves chai to Gul Ahsaan, 60, a trucker who looks forward to driving the new road. ""My tires won't burst and I won't need to repair my truck,"" he says, gesturing to his vehicle. It is painted with birds and trees and adorned with bells and mini F-16 model jets. ""He wants to fly,"" his friend jokes.
 
 In a nearby town, sports supervisor Qazi Ishaq, 45, hopes the improved road brings tourists. He's overseeing boys playing hockey, cricket and soccer on a large field.
 
 Girls don't play sports in this part of rural Pakistan; they rarely venture outside. Might a new road change these customs? ""Our culture will not be affected,"" Ishaq insists. ""Women in our area observe purdah,"" he says, referring to the practice of seclusion and veiling.
 
 As the Karakoram veers closer to China, a few trucks are idling while yaks block the highway. Their herder, Suhail Abbas, says his fortunes have changed since a Chinese company repaved this section of the road three years ago. ""People now have money for meat,"" he says, grinning.
 
 Enlarge this image toggle caption Diaa Hadid/NPR Diaa Hadid/NPR
 
 Locals are making money from tourism and are buying more yaks, Abbas says. This year, he began with 500 and sold all but 32. ""People like it because they don't eat anything other than grass,"" he says, sounding more like a hipster butcher than a grime-streaked 23-year-old shepherd. Before the road was fixed, he was selling barely 15 a year, and was surviving on chai and bread.
 
 The bustle is apparent in the nearby border town of Sost, where cargo trucks come from across Pakistan to collect Chinese imports processed at the local dry port. Dozens of men sit outside, waiting for dollar-a-day jobs unloading boxes. Mohammad Iqbal, a 29-year-old customs official, says that when he was growing up, ""there was only one shop, only one hotel.""

 ""There were only buses, carrying the pilgrims from China to Pakistan who had to go to hajj,"" he says — the first part of the journey to Muslim holy sites in Saudi Arabia. The pilgrims, mostly from China's Uighur Muslim minority, no longer come. ""An internal matter,"" he shrugs, alluding to the widespread crackdown on the minority in China.
 
 Curling toward the Khunjerab Pass, vehicles dodge fallen rocks as they navigate narrow hairpin turns. Minivans ply the route, suitcases piled on their roofs, ferrying Pakistanis for study and trade in China. Tourists pose for selfies at the border.
 
 So far, the road has not met expectations for increasing cross-border trade, says Andrew Small, the author of The China-Pakistan Axis. Instead, the highway's main purpose has been ""to cement the strategic partnership"" between the two countries. And it has potential military use, he says. ""It improves the capacity for cross-border mobility and for troop mobility"" to defend disputed territories under its control from India. The far north is considered part of the contested Himalayan territory of Kashmir, although it is culturally and religiously distinct. Residents there do not identify as Kashmiri. Clashes between Pakistan and India in this part of the territory are rare.
 
 Liaqat Ali Shah, the Pakistani director of CPEC, says trade will pick up as China industrializes Xinjiang province. Industries there could use the Karakoram Highway, the first road in a series to the southern Pakistani port of Gwadar, which opens to the Arabian Sea. ""Definitely once the region develops,"" Shah says, ""there is a viable option to trade.""
 
 Back in Sost, Bibi Halima, 45, a teacher, expects more prosperity to come. ""Because of the Karakoram Highway and, now CPEC, more things will be established here. There'll be more jobs,"" Halima says.
 
 But sometimes, she volunteers, she longs for when Sost was isolated and poor. ""We used to have plenty of time,"" she says. ""I'd come back from teaching and we'd just sit around.""
 
 Today, with the highway, ""time is valuable,"" she says. ""I don't even have a single second to spare.""

61,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer,-1,,UK,W,2018-07-30 00:00:00,What is China's Belt and Road Initiative?,"What is China's Belt and Road Initiative? The project is often described as a 21st century silk road, made up of a “belt” of overland corridors and a maritime “road” of shipping lanes. China is carrying out or planning construction projects in more than 60 countries along these routes.
 
 Beijing’s multibillion dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been called a Chinese Marshall Plan, a state-backed campaign for global dominance, a stimulus package for a slowing economy, and a massive marketing campaign for something that was already happening – Chinese investment around the world.
 
 Over the five years since President Xi Jinping announced his grand plan to connect Asia, Africa and Europe, the initiative has morphed into a broad catchphrase to describe almost all aspects of Chinese engagement abroad.
 
 Belt and Road, or yi dai yi lu, is a “21st century silk road,” confusingly made up of a “belt” of overland corridors and a maritime “road” of shipping lanes.
 
 From South-east Asia to Eastern Europe and Africa, Belt and Road includes 71 countries that account for half the world’s population and a quarter of global GDP.
 
 Everything from a Trump-affiliated theme park in Indonesia to a jazz camp in Chongqing have been branded Belt and Road. Countries from Panama to Madagascar, South Africa to New Zealand, have officially pledged support.
 
 How much money is being spent?
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative is expected to cost more than $1tn (£760bn), although there are differing estimates as to how much money has been spent to date. According to one analysis, China has invested more than $210bn, the majority in Asia.
 
 But China’s efforts abroad don’t stop there. Belt and Road also means that Chinese firms are engaging in construction work across the globe on an unparalleled scale.
 
 According to one estimate, China has invested more than $200 bn into Belt and Road projects abroad. 1/3 Source: American Enterprise Institute. Values shown are cumulative
 
 To date, Chinese companies have secured more than $340bn in construction contracts along the Belt and Road.
 
 However, China’s dominance in the construction sector comes at the expense of local contractors in partner countries.
 
 The vast sums raked in by Chinese firms are at odds with the official rhetoric that Belt and Road is open to global participation and suggest that the initiative is also motivated by factors other than trade, such as China’s need to combat excess capacity at home.
 
 What are the risks for countries involved?
 
 More recently, governments from Malaysia to Pakistan are starting to rethink the costs of these projects. Sri Lanka, where the government leased a port to a Chinese company for 99 years after struggling to make repayments, is a cautionary tale.
 
 Earlier this year, the Center for Global Development found eight more Belt and Road countries at serious risk of not being able to repay their loans.
 
 The affected nations – Djibouti, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, the Maldives, Mongolia, Montenegro, Pakistan and Tajikistan – are among the poorest in their respective regions and will owe more than half of all their foreign debt to China.
 
 Critics worry China could use “debt-trap diplomacy” to extract strategic concessions – such as over territorial disputes in the South China Sea or silence on human rights violations. In 2011, China wrote off an undisclosed debt owed by Tajikistan in exchange for 1,158 sq km (447 sq miles) of disputed territory.
 
 “There are some extreme cases where China lends into very high risk environments, and it would seem that the motivation is something different. In these situations the leverage China has as lender is used for purposes unrelated to the original loan,” said Scott Morris, one of the authors of the Washington Centre for Global Development report.
 
 Why is the initiative sparking global concern?
 
 As Belt and Road expands in scope so do concerns it is a form of economic imperialism that gives China too much leverage over other countries, often those that are smaller and poorer.
 
 Jane Golley, an associate professor at Australian National University, describes it as an attempt to win friends and influence people. “They’ve presented this very grand initiative which has frightened people,” says Golley. “Rather than using their economic power to make friends, they’ve drummed up more fear that it will be about influence.”
 
 According to Shan Wenhua, a professor at Jiaotong University in Xi’an, Xi’s signature foreign policy is “the first major attempt by the Chinese government to take a proactive approach toward international cooperation … to take responsibility.”
 
 Some worry expanded Chinese commercial presence around the world will eventually lead to expanded military presence. Last year, China established its first overseas military base in Djibouti. Analysts say almost all the ports and other transport infrastructure being built can be dual-use for commercial and military purposes.
 
 “If it can carry goods, it can carry troops,” says Jonathan Hillman, director of the Reconnecting Asia project at CSIS.
 
 Others worry China will export its political model. Herbert Wiesner, general secretary of Germany’s PEN Center, says human rights are being “left in the ditches by the sides of the New Silk Road”.
 
 Where does it end?
 
 Belt and Road is likely to continue, not least because these projects signal loyalty to Xi. The initiative has been enshrined in the Chinese communist party’s constitution, which also eliminated term limits, leaving Xi room to continue Belt and Road for as long as he wants.
 
 It also gives disparate Chinese projects overseas the veneer of being part of a grand strategic plan, according to Winslow Robertson, a specialist in China-Africa relations. It is not a centralised initiative, so much as a brand, he says.
 
 “Who determines what is a Belt and Road project or a Belt and Road country? Nobody is sure. Everything and nothing is Belt and Road.”
 
 What’s next?
 
 Not all of the most ambitious Belt and Road projects are about hard infrastructure. China plans to set up international courts, in Shenzhen and Xi’an, the former hub of the original Silk Road, to resolve commercial disputes related to Belt and Road.
 
 “It’s a reminder BRI is about more than roads, railways, and other hard infrastructure,” said Jonathan Hillman, director of the Reconnecting Asia project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It’s also a vehicle for China to write new rules, establish institutions that reflect Chinese interests, and reshape ‘soft’ infrastructure.”
 
 Officials have said the courts, to be based on the judiciary, arbitration and mediation agencies of China’s Supreme People’s Court in Beijing, will follow international rules and will invite legal experts from outside China to participate.
 
 Legal experts say the courts will likely be modelled on the Dubai International Financial Centre Courts and the International Commercial Court in Singapore, which has already struck an agreement with China to resolve Belt and Road-related disputes.
 
 But critics of the independence of the country’s judicial system, which traditionally answers to China’s ruling communist party, worry the courts will favour Chinese parties over foreign firms.","['initiative', 'countries', 'projects', 'global', 'chinese', 'belt', 'chinas', 'china', 'international', 'road']","{'Australia': 1, 'China': 23, 'Germany': 1, 'Djibouti': 2, 'Indonesia': 1, 'Kyrgyzstan': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'Madagascar': 1, 'Maldives': 1, 'Montenegro': 1, 'Mongolia': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'New Zealand': 1, 'Pakistan': 2, 'Panama': 1, 'Singapore': 1, 'Tajikistan': 2, 'South Africa': 1}",,,,,

 The three-day forum starting on Thursday is meant to promote Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s “project of the century”, a foreign policy initiative launched in 2013 to revive ancient trading routes between Asia and Europe, as well as build new links in the Middle East, Africa, and South America.
 
 But in contrast to its first summit two years ago, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) takes place in a much less welcoming environment. Critics say the initiative is an effort to cement Chinese influence around the world by financially binding countries to Beijing by way of “debt trap diplomacy”.

 “The ‘Belt and Road initiative’ (BRI) is not a geopolitical tool but a platform for cooperation,” Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said last week, ahead of the forum “We welcome all parties to take part in it.”
 
 This week’s event is especially important for Beijing, which uses the forum as a way to convince the international community, as well as its own citizens, of the success of the project.
 
 Beijing is likely to laud the memoranda of understanding signed at the event, which will conclude with a joint communique.

 “The overall purpose of the Belt and Road initiative is to generate legitimacy for the Chinese leadership and the Chinese Communist Party more broadly,” said Thomas Eder, a research associate at the Mercator Institute for Chinese Studies.
 
 “Such prestige is bolstered by every government signing a BRI memorandum of understanding and every head of government attending a grand BRI summit in Beijing. These countries allow Xi Jinping to then tell Chinese citizens that the entire world is endorsing his policies and that he is the one to have put China firmly back at the centre of the global stage,” Eder said.
 
 The event is to be attended by 37 leaders, including Russian president Vladimir Putin, Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte, UK chancellor Philip Hammond, Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan and the heads of state of the 10 Asean (Association of South-east Asian Nation) states. The US is reportedly sending low-level delegates, and India is not attending.
 
 Countries that previously attended but have chosen not to come this year include Turkey, which has publicly criticised China over is treatment of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority, Poland, Spain, Fiji, Sri Lanka, and Argentina, according to the Eurasia Group, citing geopolitical issues as a possible reason.

 Critics have also called for China to institutionalise the Belt and Road initiative, so that the project is not seen as entirely Chinese-led. Others have cited environmental concerns, as Chinese companies build coal power projects around the world. Coal projects accounted for as much as 42% of China’s overseas investment in 2018, according to the China Global Energy Finance database.
 
 “For the sake of the planet, for people who could be breathing in pollutants from coal plants and for the long-term economic health of many developing countries, let’s hope BRI quits coal,” said Wawa Wang, senior adviser at VedvarendeEnergi in Denmark.
 
 The $900bn question: what is the Belt and Road initiative? Read more
 
 Ahead of the forum, China has scored some key wins for the project. Italy is now the first G7 country to endorse the initiative, after signing up for Belt and Road in March, despite criticism from the US. This month, Malaysia agreed to continue a $10.7bn rail project, previously cancelled.
 
 So far, China has signed more than 170 agreements with 125 countries, according to Chinese state media. Between 2013 and 2018, these deals totalled more than $90bn in Chinese investment.
 
 Beijing has also begun to take some steps to soothe concerns. Officials are reportedly drafting rules on which projects can be called “Belt and Road”, to prevent the initiative’s brand from being diluted by unsuccessful projects. Chinese ambassadors in Kenya and Mexico have published editorials in local media defending the initiative.
 
 On Friday, Xi will give a keynote address, where he is likely to strike a similar tone. “The Belt and Road is an initiative for economic cooperation, instead of a geopolitical alliance or military league, and it is an open and inclusive process rather than an exclusive bloc or ‘China club’,” Xi said in remarks given at a symposium in August.","['initiative', 'tough', 'projects', 'chinese', 'belt', 'hits', 'xi', 'chinas', 'china', 'bri', 'forum', 'times', 'century', 'road', 'project']","{'Argentina': 1, 'China': 11, 'Denmark': 1, 'Spain': 1, 'Fiji': 1, 'India': 1, 'Italy': 1, 'Kenya': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'Mexico': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Poland': 1, 'Turkey': 1, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned China against damaging the environment through unsustainable overseas investments as part of its “belt and road” infrastructure initiative.
 
 Christine Lagarde, the IMF’s managing director, used a speech in Beijing on Friday to urge the Chinese government to focus the initiative, which involves spending billions on overseas infrastructure projects to connect China with the world, on sustainable development.
 
 Lagarde also said investment should not build up vast levels of debt that could prove problematic in future. “I have said before that, to be fully successful, the belt and road should only go where it is needed. I would add today that it should only go where it is sustainable, in all aspects,” she said.
 
 She was speaking at a gathering of world leaders in the Chinese capital to pitch for investment via the belt androad project.

 Philip Hammond, the British chancellor, was at the event to promote Britain, although it came during a diplomatic row over UK contracts for the Chinese telecoms company Huawei amid national security concerns.
 
 China had said on Thursday it would take greater account of environmental issues in its investment decisions.
 
 Global concern is rising over the impact of climate change, illustrated by the Extinction Rebellion protests in Britain and school strikes across Europe sparked by the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.
 
 Lagarde said: “The launch of the green investment principle at this conference is a further important step forward for the belt and road initiative – and a step forward for green, low-carbon and climate-resilient investment.
 
 “Debt sustainability and green sustainability will strengthen belt and road sustainability.”
 
 Xi Jinping, China’s president, sought to allay concerns over the initiative, which aims to expand Chinese influence around the world but has generated concerns over its sustainability.
 
 Developing countries, where much of the spending has been directed, have broadly welcomed the initiative to expand trade between Asia, Africa and Europe by building roads, ports and other facilities and infrastructure.
 
 However, there are fears some countries could fall into debt traps because of the high costs of the projects. China’s debt levels have also surged in recent years, prompting fears over its financial stability.
 
 There are also concerns about corruption, and the environmental impact of projects which link China to natural resource-rich economies.
 
 Xi said: “Everything should be done in a transparent way and we should have zero tolerance for corruption.”
 
 Western countries, led by the US under Donald Trump in particular, worry Beijing is trying to build a network that could threaten their traditional economic dominance.
 
 Xi is trying to reboot the initiative after the number of new projects fell last year.
 
 China had increased the scrutiny of its state-owned banks involved in funding the plans, amid fears over rising debts and after some target countries complained the projects would not do enough for their economies and gave too much power to Beijing.
 
 Malaysia and Thailand are among countries that have cancelled or scaled back projects, while Ethiopia has renegotiated its debt repayments.

 The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MoU) that could lead to Italy’s participation in China’s Belt and Road initiative (BRI), an ambitious project that envisages Chinese investment in a network of infrastructure projects connecting Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
 
 “It’s now time for a more effective relationship between Italy and China,” Conte said.

 Xi was treated like royalty during a two-day visit to Rome, during which the two countries struck about 10 other commercial deals in a variety of areas, including tourism, food and football.
 
 But his ultimate goal was ensuring Italy’s contribution to his $1tn (£760bn) BRI enterprise, a move that gives legitimacy to an initiative dismissed by the US as a “vanity project”.
 
 Xi cited Marco Polo, the Venetian merchant and explorer who travelled the old Silk Road in the middle ages, as being the “first bridge” between Italy and China. The modern-day version envisages a network of ports, railways, tunnels and other infrastructure spanning 60 countries.
 
 The Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, also gave his backing to the deal, saying that China and Italy were “ideal travel companions” as he raised a toast with Xi during a gala dinner at the presidential palace on Friday night.
 
 As the two countries celebrated, the US – which believes China is using the project to embolden its political and strategic clout – and the EU looked on with trepidation. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, warned Italy against “naivety”. “You have to take into account the possibility that China, through the policies, is also pursuing some of its national interests,” he told reporters in Brussels on Friday.
 
 Xi travels to Palermo on Saturday afternoon before heading on to Monaco and Paris, where Emmanuel Macron is reportedly arranging a meeting with Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker on Tuesday. Macron has called for a coordinated EU-wide approach towards China.
 
 Italy’s former centre-left administration expressed the first overtures towards the accord, with ex-prime minister Paolo Gentiloni attending a BRI summit, but it was eventually spearheaded by the Five Star Movement, the Eurosceptic party that came to power alongside the far-right League last June. The party believes the agreement will revive Italy’s stagnant economy, bring in much-needed investment for the country’s ports and infrastructure, and boost exports to China’s lucrative – if crowded – market.
 
 Party members have dismissed European concerns as hypocritical, particularly as several member states already loosely collaborate in the BRI. For example, Duisburg in Germany is a crucial trade hub thanks to its rail connection with China, while the port of Hamburg also plays a prominent role.
 
 “Everyone is somehow involved in the project but no other G7 country has signed an MoU of this kind,” said Renzo Cavalieri, a professor of law of east Asian countries at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice.
 
 “What Italy has done, in quite a disordered way, is take a step ahead to create something which, so far, is not that strong in content but is quite important symbolically.”
 
 One of the main criticisms is the Italian government’s failure to consult its EU and US allies and research the geopolitical issues. But the EU snub could also be because of the bloc’s failure to come up with a common China strategy that is favourable for all member states. Italy’s share of Chinese investments has lagged in recent years compared with France and Germany’s. Meanwhile, southern European states have tended to benefit less from deals with China because their companies are smaller and finances weaker.
 
 “There is an approach by our government that is not friendly towards the European commission, but the EU has had problems in adopting a policy on China that would benefit all,” said Cavalieri.","['silk', 'roadstyle', 'eu', 'trade', 'italys', 'network', 'states', 'italy', 'china', 'bri', 'xi', 'plan', 'project']","{'China': 13, 'Germany': 2, 'France': 1, 'Italy': 12, 'Monaco': 1, 'United States': 4}",,,,,

 Traders say visitor numbers collapsed a couple of months ago after the Chinese tightened import controls and restricted the movement of people between the two sides. This was ostensibly done to crack down on corruption, but ethnic discrimination and political tension may be a bigger factor.
 
 On the walls of every shopping mall on the Chinese side are posters forbidding entry to any man with a long beard or any woman with a hijab. Visitors must pass through a metal detector and have their bag checked by security guards. On the streets outside, there are CCTV cameras and the police presence is striking. This is due to tensions in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Several cities there have witnessed ethnic riots, terrorist attacks and fierce repression by state security forces, who have blocked all public displays of Islamic faith.
 
 This threatens to undermine Khorgos. Most traders are Muslim and unhappy at restrictions on their co-religionists. As businessmen, they are also troubled by the frequent regulatory changes.
 
 It is clear China is calling the shots, but its heavy-handedness has not halted corruption. Businessmen in the neutral zone say they can bribe customs officials to ensure their goods get through, that illegal casinos and brothels operate inside the shells of half-completed buildings, and that there have been secret bare-knuckle boxing tournaments, where spectators could gamble on two teams formed of 10 Chinese and 10 Kazakh fighters.
 
 But Khorgos is more than a bizarre bazaar. The entire region around it is being transformed. Construction will soon begin on an airport. Work is already under way on an industrial centre, which will offer a rent holiday and zero taxation until 2035. Eventually the region’s planners hope to attract IT and robotics companies. By 2025, they aim to create 25,000 jobs.
 
 Zhasulan Khamzin cheerfully admits he had never heard of Khorgos before moving here five years ago to manage the world’s biggest dry port and the installation of three 41-tonne gantries to move containers across flatbed trains on the different gauge tracks on the two sides of the border. “We are developing an area where there was nothing before,” he says. “We are pioneers.”
 
 The first train passed through in July 2015. A year later, the facility handled 45,000 containers. This year, it is set to exceed 150,000. Meanwhile, a new dormitory town – Nurkent – has been built from scratch and is home to 4,000 families. Khamzin predicts this too will become a city.
 
 “Nurkent is still just a baby, but it will grow. This will be one of the biggest cities in Kazakhstan. By 2035, we expect 100,000 people will live here,” he says.
 
 The climate is not exactly welcoming. In winter, residents put up with thick snow and temperatures as low as -36C (-32F). In summer, they bake in 40C (104F) heat. But relatively high salaries, no tax and free accommodation are bringing people in.
 
 “I didn’t want to come but I had no choice, because my previous company went out of business,” says crane operator Osipova Galina, as she sits down after a 12-hour shift. “My first impression wasn’t good. Just very ugly shopping malls surrounded by a barbed wire fence.”

 The Belt and Road forum, which opens on Friday in Beijing, has been billed by climate campaigners as a pivotal moment that will determine whether China uses its vast financial weight to nudge the world towards renewable energy or continues to promote expansion by its fossil fuel companies.
 
 In recent years Chinese banks have become the lenders of last resort for coal projects in south Asia, Africa and the Balkans that the World Bank and other international institutes have refused to fund because this dirtiest of fuels is the primary source of carbon emissions from electricity generation.
 
 Although China has won kudos for trying to clean up its environment by cutting dependence on coal, its companies are making up for lost business at home by expanding overseas. Most of their funding comes from the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
 
 The strategy will be reviewed at the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, which will run until 27 April and will be attended by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, the International Monetary Fund head, Christine Lagarde, and 37 heads of state.
 
 Although it is not billed by organisers as a climate event, this may prove to be the most important event of the year for global emissions, such is the scale of proposed investments in energy, roads, railways, dams and ports.
 
 China says the BRI, which was launched by the president, Xi Jinping, in 2013, accelerates development in many of the world’s poorest countries and builds trade routes that benefit the global economy.
 
 Critics say it is a tool to project geopolitical power, suck up overseas resources and vent the excess capacity of a slowing domestic economy, particularly in the steel, construction and power industries. From an environmental perspective, the primary concern is that Beijing is exporting a highly polluting model of growth.
 
 The promised splurge on infrastructure dwarfs anything the world has seen before. Morgan Stanley predicts BRI investment will rise above $1tn over the next decade. The initiative already covers 124 countries that together account for two-thirds of the world’s population and a third of global GDP.
 
 The forum will review the progress so far and set the direction for the next five years, with a central focus on the “quality” of projects. For climate campaigners, this is seen as the best opportunity to date to reduce emissions.
 
 Coal is likely to be at the centre of the debate. China’s banks have earmarked $36bn for 102 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity in 23 countries, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Last year two-fifths of the country’s overseas investment was reportedly spent on this dirty energy.
 
 The biggest recipient, with $7bn, is Bangladesh, where China is vying for influence with Japan, South Korea and India. All four countries are building thermal plants in Bangladesh. Last year China Huadian Hongkong Company Limited signed a deal with a local partner to build a 1,320-megawatt plant at Moheshkhali island.
 
 In Africa, there are projects in Malawi and South Africa. Mohamed Adow, from Christian Aid, said China’s projects were locking the continent into out-of-date technology. “It is deeply unfair for China to get Africa hooked on fossil fuels and debt when it comes to building Africa’s infrastructure while China is starting to adopt clean, cheap, technologies of the 21st century,” he said.

 The government in Pakistan has embraced the opportunity to make up shortages in energy supply. At the opening last week of a 660MW coal power station in Tharparkar – supported by China Machinery Engineering Corporation – officials declared the new facility to be “the pride of Pakistan”, but the plant will make the country dependent on a new open-cast coalmine that will produce 3.8m tonnes of low-quality fuel each year. Climate campaigners said this was a missed opportunity because the surrounding Sindh province had rich potential for renewables, with wind corridors and abundant sunlight.
 
 In Europe, China is financing, building or equipping 4.1GW of coal-fired plants, according to the Danish NGO VedvarendeEnergi (Sustainable Energy), including the Kostolac B3 power station in Serbia and the Tuzla 7 plant in Bosnia, which are subject to investigations, lawsuits or petitions from environmental groups.
 
 Wawa Wang, a senior adviser to VedvarendeEnergi, said the forum should address the double standards between China’s domestic climate actions and its overseas actions. “I’d like to see China introduce binding policy and law that restrict financing of overseas coal projects,” she said.
 
 Xi has declared that the BRI should be green. But the balance so far has been towards black energy. A coalition of 10 Chinese NGOs have petitioned the government to change tack, as have reports by Chatham House and research institutes in the US. Pressure is also likely to come from the growing number of international partners involved in other BRI projects, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the UK government.
 
 But it is the host nation that is providing the vast majority of funds, which means decisions will rest with Chinese bankers, Chinese officials and, most of all, the Chinese president.","['puts', 'coal', 'projects', 'chinese', 'belt', 'climate', 'overseas', 'international', 'china', 'funding', 'summit', 'spotlight', 'energy', 'power', 'world', 'road']","{'Bangladesh': 2, 'China': 15, 'India': 1, 'Japan': 1, 'Malawi': 1, 'Pakistan': 2, 'Serbia': 1, 'United States': 1, 'South Africa': 1}",,,,,

 The Belt and what initiative?
 
 Even Chinese officials have struggled to define the awkwardly-named scheme and a flurry of music-themed propaganda about Xi’s signature foreign policy in the lead-up to this weekend’s event has done little to clear things up.
 
 “It is not a solo song but a chorus,” one veteran Chinese diplomat claimed cryptically this week.
 
 “[It is] a Chinese solution to global economic blues,” said the official news agency Xinhua.
 
 Foreign minister Wang Yi has described the initiative as a “symphony of all relevant parties”.
 
 In concrete terms, the Belt and Road initiative is an immensely ambitious development campaign through which China wants to boost trade and stimulate economic growth across Asia and beyond. It hopes to do so by building massive amounts of infrastructure connecting it to countries around the globe. By some estimates, China plans to pump $150bn into such projects each year. In a report released at the start of this year, ratings agency Fitch said an extraordinary $900bn in projects were planned or underway.
 
 
 
 There are plans for pipelines and a port in Pakistan, bridges in Bangladesh and railways to Russia - all with the aim of creating what China calls a “modern Silk Road” trading route that Beijing believes will kick start “a new era of globalisation”.
 
 According to the global consultancy McKinsey, the plan has the potential to massively overshadow the US’ post-war Marshall reconstruction plan, involving about 65% of the world’s population, one-third of its GDP and helping to move about a quarter of all its goods and services. Some describe Xi’s scheme as the biggest development push in history.
 
 But why Belt and Road?
 
 The Belt and Road initiative has two main prongs: one is called the ‘Silk Road Economic Belt’ (the belt) and the other the ‘21st Century Maritime Silk Road’ (the road).
 
 Bewilderingly, the ‘road’ is not actually a road but rather a sea route linking China’s southern coast to east Africa and the Mediterranean. The ‘belt’ is a series of overland corridors connecting China with Europe, via Central Asia and the Middle East.
 
 “It is a very confusing name,” admits Peter Cai, the author of a recent report about Belt and Road, who blames China’s propaganda-focused state media for failing to properly explain the concept to the world. “There is still a lot of confusion about what the Belt and Road initiative is and what it actually entails.”
 
 The initiative’s Chinese name - yi dai yi lu or “one belt, one road” - rolls off the tongue far more easily.
 
 When did it start and what has happened?
 
 The initiative was officially launched in September 2013 when President Xi used a speech at a university in Kazakhstan to call for the creation of a “Silk Road Economic Belt”. The project was later expanded and re-branded with its current name.
 
 
 
 Beijing has championed a number of achievements, foremost among them the $62 billion China-Pakistan economic corridor (Cpec), a sprawling web of motorways, power plants, wind farms, factories and railways, that supporters say will spark an “economic revolution” and create up to one million jobs in Pakistan. Other high-profile schemes include a $1.1 billion port project in Sri Lanka, a high-speed rail link in Indonesia and an industrial park in Cambodia.
 
 However, experts say that nearly four years after the initiative began most projects remain on the drawing board. “We really are at a very early stage of implementation,” says Cai, a fellow at Australia’s Lowy Institute. “It’s still early days to pass a judgement on the success or failure of the Belt and Road.”
 
 At this weekend’s conference, China hopes to put some meat on the bones of Xi’s pet project.
 
 
 
 Why is the Belt and Road initiative so important to China?
 
 Observers say a number of overlapping goals lie behind China’s ‘Belt and Road’ campaign.
 
 In many ways it is an economic plan designed to open up and create new markets for Chinese goods and technology at a time when the economy is slowing and to help export excess cement and steel capacity by shifting factories overseas to less developed countries. Beijing also hopes Xi’s initiative will help boost the economies of less developed border regions such as Xinjiang by linking them with neighbouring countries.
 
 But many believe the Belt and Road initiative is also a geopolitical gambit to boost China’s regional clout at a time when Donald Trump’s US looks to be stepping back from Asia. “It’s about making China the dominant country in the region,” says Tom Miller, the author of a book about the scheme called China’s Asian Dream.
 
 Cai said it was indisputable that Belt and Road would have geopolitical consequences, giving Beijing greater leverage over its neighbours. “It will give China more influence.”
 
 How do other countries feel about it?
 
 Xi’s initiative has been greeted with a mix of excitement and suspicion.
 
 Miller, who has visited many of the countries involved, said many governments in central and south-east Asia were genuine cheerleaders. “There are certain countries, like Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, where it is literally keeping the lights on,” he said, pointing to massive Chinese power transmission projects in those nations.
 
 Others, however, feared that by becoming indebted to Beijing they would become “economic vassals”. Some countries, such as India, suspect the project is simply a smokescreen China is using to seize strategic control of the Indian Ocean. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has accused Beijing of trying to “undermine the sovereignty of other nations” and will shun this week’s summit.
 
 Many in the west are also wary. Beijing has said 28 heads of state and government leaders will attend Xi’s forum but German chancellor Angela Merkel has turned down an invitation and US president Donald Trump is not expected to attend. Only one G7 leader, Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, has confirmed.

 Italy, which would become the first G7 country to back the initiative, hopes it will revive its sluggish economy and help open up greater access to China’s lucrative market.
 
 The Five Star Movement (M5S), the populist party governing alongside the far-right League, has been the driving force behind the country’s collaboration in an initiative the US believes is being used by China, its trade rival, to embolden its political and strategic clout.
 
 Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the White House’s group of national security advisers, earlier this month warned Italy not to lend legitimacy to China’s “infrastructure vanity project” and that doing so could damage its global reputation.

 The EU, meanwhile, fears the accord with China will stir up divisions with member states wary of Beijing’s expansionist goals. The initiative has also been criticised for mostly benefiting Chinese companies and potentially causing “debt traps” in poorer countries.
 
 Manlio Di Stefano, an undersecretary at the foreign ministry and M5S member, brushed aside these concerns, telling the Guardian the deal was about Italy “creating its own opportunity”.
 
 “It’s a collaborative initiative that will allow Italy to export more and to participate in the infrastructure for BRI,” he said. “It will definitely be a good thing for the Italian economy. Many EU countries already have big commercial agreements with China, so to me this discussion seems a little hypocritical.”

 The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, insisted on Tuesday the move would be good for the country’s economy, enabling it to boost exports to “a market of an enormous size”, and that signing the agreement posed no risk to its geo-political position. “It does not remotely put into doubt our Euro-Atlantic alliance,” he told parliament.
 
 Conte argued the memorandum was fully in line with an EU strategy to bolster infrastructure ties between Europe and Asia. “In fact, it promotes it as no other member state has done so far in its dealings with Beijing,” he said.
 
 Conte is planning to attend a BRI summit in China in April.

 Xi is expected to arrive in Rome on Thursday afternoon, before travelling to Palermo, Monaco and Paris. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said last week that EU countries should have a “coordinated approach” towards China.
 
 “It’s not so much about Italy wanting to do a deal with China per se,” said Francesco Sisci, an academic at Beijing’s Renmin University of China. “The real problem is that no political homework has been done. Italy, a bridge to Europe and, objectively, the US, spoke to China without consulting either. Fractured relations with the EU and US won’t serve Italy well, or China.”
 
 Italy has also not bowed to US-led pressure to ban the Chinese telecoms company, Huawei, from building its 5G mobile phone network. The company is under international scrutiny over its links with the Chinese government and allegations that its technology is being used by Beijing for spying.

 The M5S’s nurturing of relations with China is at odds with the League’s stance, which argued that any deal should safeguard Italy’s national interests.
 
 “If it’s a matter of helping Italian companies to invest abroad we are willing to talk to anyone,” said Matteo Salvini, the party’s leader and deputy prime minister. “But if it’s a question of colonising Italy and its firms by foreign powers, no.”
 
 Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Rome’s Luiss University, said the two parties, both Eurosceptic, had different objectives regarding the China deal.
 
 “M5S wants this MoU as it could be an occasion to produce financial resources to fund its policies and to contrast with the European commission,” he said. “For the League, which has no relations with China but is close to its competitor, Russia, it’s an occasion to demonstrate its fidelity with the US.”","['likely', 'initiative', 'eu', 'belt', 'chinese', 'trade', 'rattles', 'chinas', 'infrastructure', 'italy', 'china', 'economy', 'italian', 'support', 'road']","{'China': 16, 'France': 1, 'Italy': 12, 'Monaco': 2, 'United States': 6}",,,,,

 The Victorian government has bowed to pressure and released its agreement with China on the Belt and Road initiative as experts warn that the decision to sign on could be unconstitutional.
 
 The state is the first in Australia to sign up to the Chinese president Xi Jinping’s signature global trade and infrastructure program, earning a rebuke from the prime minister, Scott Morrison.
 
 The four-page memorandum of understanding states Victoria and China will work together to “inject new momentum” to achieve common development and promote connectivity of policy, infrastructure, trade, finance and people.

 Businesses and organisations on both sides will develop long-term partnerships, the document says. The parties will enhance policy cooperation and “unimpeded trade”. The agreement is not legally binding and expires in five years.
 
 Labor insiders have been quick to play down the agreement as being a “series of motherhood statements” that doesn’t commit to anything specific.
 
 But the Australian Strategic Policy Institute director, Peter Jennings, is alarmed that Victoria may have overstepped the mark, after the federal government declined to sign up.
 
 “My take on it is it was wrong for a state government to sign something like this – it might even be unconstitutional,” Jennings told Guardian Australia.
 
 “It may not be tested, of course, but it strikes me as something the Victorians would have been wiser not to agree to.”
 
 The agreement could be viewed as a form of inappropriate “political interference” by China, he said.
 
 “They didn’t get the answer they wanted from one jurisdiction … so they went to another one, really with the effect of undermining the federal government’s position,” Jennings said.
 
 He said he hoped other state leaders would be discouraged from copying Victoria. “Frankly, there is a bit of a trend at the moment for state leaders to go over to China with dollar signs rolling in their eyes, with how much money they can make from engagement,” he said.
 
 An Australian National University academic, Prof Rory Medcalf, agreed the agreement could be “pushing the boundaries” on Australia’s constitution.
 
 “It’s hard to see the point of the whole exercise, in terms of the interests of the state of Victoria and the Australian national interest,” Medcalf told the Guardian Australia.
 
 “It contains an uncritical endorsement of everything that occurs under the rubric of Belt and Road. It does hand a propaganda win to China in its own differences with the Australian government over this issue.”

 The federal government and the opposition have kept the initiative at arm’s length, saying they will look at cooperating on projects on merit.
 
 Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, insists that the agreement makes economic sense for his state. “This new Australian-first agreement sums up everything we have achieved with China over the past four years – it means more trade and more Victorian jobs and an even stronger relationship with China,” Andrews said last month.
 
 He was the only Australian state leader to attend China’s Belt and Road international summit in May last year.
 
 Belt and Road is a vast Chinese infrastructure plan to connect China via the ancient Silk Road land route and sea routes with Eurasia, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe in an attempt to boost trade and economic growth while cutting transit time for goods.
 
 The scheme has attracted international criticism for China’s use of “debtbook diplomacy”.","['initiative', 'deal', 'release', 'state', 'victoria', 'agreement', 'belt', 'trade', 'australian', 'china', 'sign', 'road', 'pressure', 'bows']","{'Australia': 10, 'China': 10}",,,,,

So will the next one | Martin Jacques,"By 2010, China was beginning to have an impact on the global consciousness in a new way. Prior to the western financial crisis, it had been seen as the new but very junior kid on the block. The financial crash changed all that. Before 2008 the conventional western wisdom had been that sooner or later China would suffer a big economic meltdown. It never did. Instead, the crisis happened in the west, with huge consequences for the latter’s stability and self-confidence.

 Every year for the past decade, China, not the US, has been the main source of global economic growth. In 2014, according to the World Bank’s international comparison program, the Chinese economy overtook that of the US to become the world’s largest, measured by purchasing power parity. Although China’s growth rate over the past decade has declined to its present 6.2%, it is still one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. Today its economy is more than twice as big as it was in 2010.
 
 This is the story, as pertaining to the past decade, of the most remarkable economic transformation in human history. Unsurprisingly the west is finding the phenomenon difficult to come to terms with, displaying a kaleidoscope of emotions from denial, dismissal and condemnation to respect, appreciation and admiration; though there is presently much more of the former than the latter. The rise of China has provoked an existential crisis in the US and Europe that will last for the rest of this century. The west is in the process of being displaced and, beyond a point, it can do nothing about it. China’s rise is one of those world-transforming changes that occur very rarely in history. And only during this past decade has the west begun to realise that China’s rise will, indeed, change the world.
 
 The story keeps moving. Five years, let alone a decade, ago, China was synonymous with cheap manufacturing. The west believed that China would for long remain essentially defined by imitation, unable to match the west’s capacity for innovation. But China has proven itself to have a formidably innovative economy. Shenzhen has come to rival Silicon Valley – while Huawei, Tencent and Alibaba can be counted in the same league as Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Amazon. Far from this being a product of copying, the Chinese are increasingly engaging in groundbreaking innovation: China accounted for almost half of all patent filings in the world last year. But why should we be surprised? People living in a country growing at 10% per annum for 35 years and between 6% and 8% for the past decade are used to rapid change and constant innovation. And don’t forget that China is an extraordinarily rich and intellectually endowed civilization that has always been hugely committed to learning and education.
 
 Q&A What is the China-US trade war about? Show Hide The roots of the dispute come from US president Donald Trump’s “America first” project to protect the US’ position as the world’s leading economy, while encouraging businesses to hire more workers in the US and to manufacture their products there. Trump complains of a large trade deficit with China, which he views as a symbol of the US’s decline as a manufacturing powerhouse. Chinese imports to the US totalled $539.5bn last year, while $120.3bn was sold the other way – leaving a trade deficit of $419.2bn. The president has accused Beijing of “unfair” trade policies, including allowing the theft of US companies’ intellectual property. The threat of import tariffs on Chinese goods is being used as leverage in talks where Trump is seeking changes to Beijing’s trade policy. Tariffs have been imposed by Washington on some Chinese goods sold in the US for about a year. They came on top of broader tariffs used by Trump that have hit China and other trading partners such as the EU, Canada and Mexico, on goods including steel and aluminium. In May 2019 the US president further ratcheted up existing import tariffs of 10% on $200bn (£153bn) of Chinese goods sold in the US to 25%, hitting everything on a long list of products. Trump has previously warned that 25% tariffs could be slapped on a further $325bn of goods – which would mean all Chinese imports being covered by tariffs. However, talks in November 2019 aimed at easing tensions were welcomed as the beginning of a thaw in the trade war between the two nations. Richard Partington and Jasper Jolly
 
 Perhaps the starkest demonstration of China’s growing influence has been the belt and road initiative – a global network of Chinese-financed highways, railways, ports and energy infrastructure, launched in 2013. The ambition is no less than the transformation of the Eurasian landmass, home to more than 60% of the world’s population. More than 140 countries, overwhelmingly from the developing world, have now signed up; and the great majority were represented by their leaders at the belt and road summit held in early 2019, a level of representation no other country could match, the US included.
 
 With the present international system entering its twilight, the belt and road initiative can be seen as the embryo of a new order, not in the literal sense, but symbolically. First, with the predominance of the developing world, representing 85% of the world’s population; and second, in the overriding priority given to development, hugely important to the developing world but which barely features on the west’s agenda.
 
 For more than four decades the relationship between China and the US was relatively benign. Donald Trump’s election in 2016 marked a turning point. His hostility towards China, however, is far from unique. It is bipartisan. And not unpredictable. At root the new US attitude is based on a fear that China represents a threat to its global hegemony, something that many Americans regard to be part of the country’s DNA. This fear has in part been stimulated by China’s increasingly proactive role on the global stage, most notably with the belt and road initiative, along with the formation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to which Britain was the first non-Asian signatory.
 
 Europe is squeezed between a hungry China and surly US | Simon Tisdall Read more
 
 The US’s increasing unwillingness to support the international system that it largely created – as seen in Trump’s attitude towards the World Trade Organization and Nato – marks a retreat. It is already clear that Trump’s trade war against China has not achieved its objectives. Nor will its tech war against China: Huawei’s 5G will prevail in much of the world, probably including most of Europe. As US-China relations continue to deteriorate, and begin to look like a new cold war, it will be no replica of the last cold war. Then, the US was on the rise, the USSR in decline: this time the US is patently in decline and China very much on the rise. Whereas a singular characteristic of the last cold war was military competition, China has historically never competed as a military power and its rise – compared with the aggressive expansionism of the US, UK, France and Germany in their equivalent stages of development – has been remarkably restrained.
 
 The next decade will see a continuing fragmentation of the western-centric international system, together with the growing influence of Chinese-oriented institutions. The process will be uneven, unpredictable and, at times, fraught – but ultimately irresistible.

 China has not engaged in deliberate “debt-trap diplomacy” in the Pacific, but the burgeoning scale of China’s lending, and institutional weakness within Pacific states, pose clear risks for small states being overwhelmed by debt, a new report argues.
 
 And an infrastructure arms race between China and other countries with interests in the region – including Australia – might only exacerbate the problem.
 
 The Lowy Institute report, Ocean of Debt?, says China’s Belt and Road Initiative has exposed the issue of unsustainable debt risk for less-developed countries, in particular for the small and fragile economies of the Pacific. But the report’s authors, Roland Rajah, Alexandre Dayant and Jonathan Pryke, argue China’s global infrastructure plan presents a more “nuanced picture” than the accusation of ‘debt-trap diplomacy’ and sovereign risk to small nations unable to service their debts.

 “The evidence suggests China has not been engaged in problematic debt practices in the Pacific as to justify accusations of debt trap diplomacy, at least not to date. Still, the sheer scale of Chinese lending and the lack of strong institutional mechanisms to protect the debt sustainability of borrowing countries mean a continuation of business as usual would pose clear risks.
 
 “China will need to substantially restructure its approach if it wants to remain a major player in the Pacific without fulfilling the debt trap accusations of its critics.”
 
 “Debt-trap diplomacy”, broadly defined, is where a creditor country intentionally lends excessive credit to a smaller debtor country, with the intention of extracting economic or political concessions when the smaller country cannot service the loan.
 
 Because of small populations, fragile economies prone to external shocks (like oil price hikes) or uncontrollable events such as natural disasters, and weak institutions of government, Pacific states are acutely vulnerable to debts becoming unsustainable. Economic growth in Pacific states is “more volatile than it is fast”, and that unpredictably can make repaying large loans unsustainable, the Lowy report says.
 
 China’s massively increased aid and development presence in the Pacific is made starkly apparent by its contrasting style to traditional aid donors in the region, such as Australia.
 
 China has backed infrastructure development – usually large, landmark constructions such as bridges or significant public buildings – and usually through loans rather than through grants.
 
 “Chinese assistance is perceived to be faster, more responsive to the needs of local political elites, and have fewer conditions attached,” the Lowy report says. “As one senior Pacific bureaucrat put it: ‘we like China because they bring the red flags, not the red tape’.”
 
 China’s development presence was acutely apparent when the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, visited Fiji last week. In order to meet with the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, Morrison’s motorcade had to drive over the Fiji-China friendship bridge, and past the construction site of a Chinese-financed 30-storey tower, soon to be the tallest building in the Pacific islands.
 
 But the nature and quality of Chinese infrastructure projects have been criticised.
 
 The former international development minister, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, accused Beijing of “duchessing” the Pacific, building “white elephant” infrastructure, “roads to nowhere” and “useless buildings”.
 
 “Tied financing, little due diligence, outsized projects, weak project oversight, and fraudulent and corrupt practices are among the many criticisms that have been directed at Chinese projects,” the Lowy report said.
 
 But a 2014 study analysing the impact and quality of Chinese projects in the Pacific found some performed far better than others.
 
 “The evidence suggests that, if left alone, Chinese state firms will cut corners and inflate prices. If managed properly, they can deliver good quality infrastructure,” the Lowy report says.
 
 The case of Hambantota port in Sri Lanka is held up as an exemplar of a “debt-trap” diplomacy.
 
 After China’s Export Import Bank financed, and Chinese companies built, a new inland port in Hambantota – the home district of the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who greenlit the port, and after whom it is named – the Sri Lankan government ran into debt-related problems and a debt-for-equity swap was proposed, giving a state-owned Chinese firm a majority equity stake in the strategically located port from 2017.
 
 Similarly, Tonga, a country of 100,000 people, still owes China’s Exim Bank $108m – about 25% of Tonga’s GDP – for loans taken out in 2008 and 2010 and since deferred twice.
 
 In 2018, the then Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said Australia wanted to ensure Pacific states were not “trapped into unsustainable debt outcomes” by Chinese loans. “The trap can then be a debt-for-equity swap and they have lost their sovereignty.”
 
 And in August this year, the US Defence Secretary, Mark Esper, accused China of destabilising the region through “predatory economics and debt-for-sovereignty deals”.
 
 China has fiercely rejected the accusations.
 
 “Rather than pointing fingers at China’s good deeds, those who keep on making groundless accusations and speculations might as well do more themselves to provide help to the Pacific island countries,” Beijing’s ambassador to Samoa, Chao Xiaoliang, wrote in the Samoa Observer.

 “Some people questioned the purpose of China’s aid, even disregarded the facts and fabricated the so-called ‘China debt trap’ – this is either out of prejudice or ignorance of China’s foreign aid policy.”
 
 The Lowy paper argues that in order to avoid its Pacific infrastructure projects becoming debt traps for small nations, China should reform its lending practices to be closer to those of the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, “the standard-bearers for international good practice”.
 
 “If China wants to remain a major development financier in the Pacific without fulfilling the debt trap accusations of its critics, it will need to substantially restructure its approach, including adopting formal lending rules similar to those of the multilateral development banks.”
 
 Despite a significantly decreased aid budget – currently a historic low 0.21% of GNI – Australia remains the dominant aid provider to the region. But, as part of the Pacific Step-Up it announced in November 2018, Australia is seeking to move more into providing loans, alongside aid grants, with the $2bn Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) – $1.5bn in loans, $0.5bn in grants – as well as another $1bn in callable capital for Export Finance Australia (EFA).
 
 The Lowy paper warns against an infrastructure arms race with China in the Pacific, arguing it could worsen the risk of debt traps for island nations.

 China is set to overtake Australia as the largest donor to the Pacific region, after pledging US$4bn in aid to the region last year.
 
 Australia has traditionally been the most significant donor to the Pacific, but in 2017 China committed to spending more than four times as much as Australia, data from the Lowy Institute thinktank published today shows.
 
 Australia pledged an estimated $815m of aid to the Pacific in the financial year 2017-18, according to government budget estimates, compared with China’s $4bn for the 2017 calendar year. Most of the funds from Beijing are earmarked for infrastructure projects in Papua New Guinea.
 
 The Lowy data is calculated in calendar years, whereas the Australian federal aid budget is in financial years.
 
 The news comes amid unease in Australia about China’s growing influence in the region, which escalated to a diplomatic row earlier in the year after reports that a port funded by Chinese loans in Vanuatu was part of an attempt to establish a military presence in the region.
 
 In 2014, China was the fourth-largest donor to the region behind Australia, the US and New Zealand. However steady increases from China, combined with aid cuts by the US, has seen China rise to become the second-biggest donor by money spent and the largest donor by aid money committed in 2017.
 
 Matthew Clarke, professor of international development at Deakin University, said China’s ascendancy was “probably inevitable”, though he was “surprised it happened so quickly”.
 
 Beijing does not report its aid spending to the OECD or in its budget documents, meaning researchers at the Lowy Institute had to comb through government announcements and financial documents dating back almost 10 years.
 
 Matthew Dornan, deputy director of the policy development centre at the Australian National University, said because of how it was reported, Chinese aid pledges tended to be overstated, and he suspected not all of the $4bn pledged would end up reaching the Pacific.
 
 Australia remains the largest donor to the region in terms of money spent, having delivered $6.58bn in aid to the region between 2011 and June 2017, compared with $1.26bn of aid delivered by China from 2011 to February 2018.
 
 Overall, aid to the Pacific is in decline, shrinking 20% between 2011 and 2016. The US, EU, and France, all previously important donors, have significantly reduced their assistance.
 
 The Australian Coalition government has made aid cuts worth $11bn since assuming office in 2013, bringing the aid budget to its “least generous” level ever. Aid to the Pacific now makes up almost a third of Australia’s aid programme.
 
 Australian foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, speaking to the ABC defended Australia’s aid to the region, saying it was at “record levels”.
 
 She would not be drawn on concerns about China’s influence in the region.
 
 “We welcome the role played by all donors, including China, to support development in the Pacific,” said Bishop, adding it was important donors “don’t impose onerous debt burdens on regional governments.”
 
 But Clarke warned that if China was to become the dominant power in the region the values prized by Australia could be eroded.
 
 “The other risk is to the sovereignty of recipient nations with long-term debt levels. China makes significant concessional loans to fund infrastructure and even though they’re concessional they still need to be repaid.”
 
 He warned that if countries cannot repay the loans they may have to give China land or resources, as was the case in Sri Lanka.
 
 “I’m not strongly concerned but I am concerned. Australia has contributed to the problem by the reduction of the aid program over the last few years.”
 
 Chinese aid tends to be a mixture of traditional grants and concessional loans which are often implemented by Chinese state-owned enterprises and must be paid back with interest. As a result, some Pacific nations are starting to resist Chinese investment, for fear of becoming further indebted.

 Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands program at the Lowy Institute which collated the data, said that when it came to China “it’s really a tale of two Pacifics”, with countries like Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu and Fiji ceasing to take Chinese loans as “the hangover of the glut of China lending has started to settle in”, whereas Papua New Guinea – with a much larger population and economy – was still taking on large loans.
 
 China is set to become the largest donor to Papua New Guinea, after committing to give the nation $3.94bn last year, including $3.5bn for a national roads project.
 
 Australia has traditionally been the most significant international partner for Papua New Guinea, its closest neighbour, which was under Australian administration until 1975. Australia pledged to give Papua New Guinea $351m in 2017-2018.
 
 All of China’s top five projects, in terms of aid money pledged, are in PNG. As well as the roads project, China has promised hundreds of millions of dollars toward agriculture industrial parks, a hydropower project and a hospital.
 
 After PNG, the recipients of the largest amounts of Chinese aid in the region were Fiji ($291.94), Vanuatu ($190.65m), Samoa ($169.72m) and the Federated States of Micronesia ($86.23m).
 
 
 
 More than two-thirds of the money China has committed is promised to transport projects. In contrast, Australian aid was spread between government and civil society (35%), multi-sector/cross-cutting (15%), health (14.4%) and education (14.4%).","['papua', 'pledged', 'pacific', 'largest', 'money', 'region', 'donor', 'chinese', 'china', 'australia', 'aid', 'increase', 'huge']","{'Australia': 20, 'China': 20, 'Fiji': 3, 'France': 1, 'Guinea': 6, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'New Zealand': 1, 'Papua New Guinea': 6, 'Tonga': 1, 'United States': 4, 'Vanuatu': 3, 'Samoa': 2}",,,,,

 The academic report, from graduate students of the Harvard Kennedy school of policy analysis, was independently prepared for the state department to view and assessed the impact of China’s strategy on the influence of the US in the region.
 
 The paper identifies 16 “targets” of China’s tactic of extending hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to countries that can’t afford to pay them, and then strategically leveraging the debt.

 It said while Chinese infrastructure investment in developing countries wasn’t “inherently” against US or global interests, it became problematic when China’s use of its leverage ran counter to US interests, or if the US had strategic interests in a country which had its domestic stability undermined by unsustainable debt.
 
 The academics identified the most concerning countries, naming Pakistan and Sri Lanka as states where the process was “advanced”, with deepening debt and where the government had already ceded a key port or military base, as well places including Papua New Guinea and Thailand, where China had not yet used its amassed debt leverage.
 
 Papua New Guinea, which “has historically been in Australia’s orbit”, was also accepting unaffordable Chinese loans. While this wasn’t a significant concern yet, the report said, the country offered a “strategic location” for China, as well as large resource deposits.
 
 While there was a lack of “individual diplomatic clout” in Cambodia, Laos and the Philippines, Chinese debt could give China a “proxy veto” in Asean, the academics said.
 
 They also warned that the 2023 expiration of the compact of free association between Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands could “threaten the unfettered basing access and right of strategic denial the US has enjoyed since world war two, and help the Chinese navy extend its reach past the first island chain into the blue-water Pacific”, it said.
 
 China’s methods were “remarkably consistent”, the report said, beginning with infrastructure investments under its $1tn belt and road initiative, and offering longer term loans with extended grace periods, which was appealing to countries with weaker economies and governance.
 
 Construction projects, which the report said had a reputation for running over budget and yielding underwhelming returns, make debt repayments for the host nations more difficult.
 
 “The final phase is debt collection,” it said. “When countries prove unable to pay back their debts, China has already and is likely to continue to offer debt-forgiveness in exchange for both political influence and strategic equities.”
 
 As a case study, the report cited specific concerns about Sri Lanka granting China an 85% stake in a 99-year lease on a major port in Hambantota.
 
 The deal, which the report described as “opaque and contentious”, came after a decade of deepening debt ties with China. In 2007 China offered financing for the $361m port at a time when other entities were concerned about human rights and commercial viability, and then loaned a further $1.9bn for upgrades and an airport.
 
 By 2017, when the port deal was signed, Sri Lanka owed more than $8bn to Chinese-controlled firms. The port, which was yet to generate a profit, became a “debt trap”.
 
 “Once Sri Lanka made the initial commitment, the sunk cost and need to generate profit to pay off the original loans drove it to take out additional loans, a cycle that repeated itself until it was finally cornered into giving up the port in a debt-for-equity swap,” it said.
 
 “This has sparked fears that Hambantota could one day become a Chinese naval hub, and sent a worrying signal to other debt-strapped developing nations.”
 
 China has invested in or financed infrastructure developments across the Asian and Pacific regions, including large-scale projects representing sizeable portions of host nations’ GDP. The loans often require that Chinese companies build the projects, and complaints that locals are overlooked for a fly-in Chinese workforce are frequent.

 It has also sought to expand its military presence, prompting warnings for nearby countries including Australia. Australia’s major parties have also voiced concern about the country’s diminishing influence in the Pacific.
 
 The report recommended that the US target and streamline its investments, strengthen alliances and manage debt burdens, including through bolstering India’s role as a regional leader.
 
 Last year India warned against China’s expanding BRI and urged financial responsibility with projects that didn’t create “unsustainable debt burden for communities”.
 
 Beijing said in response that the initiative “is not and will never be neocolonialism by stealth”.

 The deep-water facility at Hambantota on the south coast of the island was officially opened by President Mahinda Rajapaksa to kick off spectacular festivities celebrating the official start of his second term in office.
 
 The Mahinda Rajapaksa port, built by Chinese labourers and engineers in a turn-key operation funded by soft Chinese loans, lies in the political heartland of Rajapaksa who, though controversial in the west for his alleged involvement in human rights abuses and autocratic style, remains popular among rural constituencies and the Sinhalese ethnic majority in the island nation. A traditional sailing yacht was the first vessel to dock in the port, followed by a cruise ship with dozens of saffron-robed Buddhist monks chanting prayers on its deck.
 
 Sri Lanka is the focus of a contest for influence between Delhi and Beijing. India is particularly concerned about the so-called ""string of pearls"" – a chain of deepwater ports built with Chinese aid along the Indian ocean coast. ""India should be closely monitoring developments like this which attest to a growing Chinese presence in the neighbourhood,"" said Uday Bhasker, a former India navy commodore.
 
 However, Professor Srikanth Kondapalli, of Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said Beijing's priority was to safeguard its access to oil: ""China imports 200m tonnes of oil each year and 80% of that travels across the Indian Ocean. They have therefore developed a series of major ports and in the future could potentially position naval military craft.""
 
 According to Sri Lankan government spokesmen, the aim of the port was ""to capitalise on the opportunity that is offered by the island's new era of peace to bring prosperity to all.""
 
 Since the end of the 25 year civil war against separatists from the nation's Tamil minority last year, the economy has boomed. A massive influx of foreign capital – and tourists – is expected with income for many Sri Lankans predicted to double in the next five or ten years.
 
 Rajapaksa, who turned 65 today, is hoping to turn Sri Lanka into a major transport and trade hub and a luxury tourist destination.

The minister for foreign affairs, Ralph Regenvanu, questioned the report’s sourcing, telling the Radio Australia’s Pacific Beat radio program: “I’m not very happy about the standard of reporting in the Australia media.”
 
 
 
 Chinese embassy officials in Vanuatu declined an interview request, saying: “The report is groundless and not worth any comment at all.”
 
 The topic quickly became the loudest non-conversation in town.
 
 'Impossible': China denies planning military base in Vanuatu Read more
 
 Tacitly at least, officials from all interested nations recognise Vanuatu’s strategic importance. Luganville, on the island of Espiritu Santo, was the site of the one of the largest military bases in the entire Pacific theatre during the second world war. Home to about 100,000 personnel at its peak, it saw nearly 1 million service personnel pass through before it was decommissioned in 1946.
 
 What was true in the 1940s remains true today: whoever controls Vanuatu controls air and sea traffic between the US and Australia. Right now, that’s the government of Vanuatu.
 
 
 
 For more than a decade, this tiny island nation has leveraged regional rivalries to drive infrastructure development. Its dalliance with China, for example, resulted in a US$20m investment by the telecom giant Huawei in an island-hopping communications network. That development is said by some to have motivated a multimillion-dollar commitment from Australia to fund telecom regulation and management.
 
 For years, western countries were simply not interested in big-ticket, high-risk projects. Infrastructure projects worldwide face budget overruns, scope creep and delays. Risk-averse donors shied away.
 
 But not China.
 
 Largely on the back of questionably “concessional” loans from the China EXIM Bank, contractors secured a mixed bag of infrastructure projects, ranging from roads to wharves to buildings. They include sport facilities, a convention centre and a school.
 
 The most noticeable scheme was a US$90m wharf project in Luganville. Almost from the outset, ni-Vanuatu raised the spectre of the old US base there.
 
 Nobody doubts Beijing’s popularity with the political elite, and that should cause concern in Canberra
 
 Many Pacific watchers think there’s no coincidence that the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and other funding bodies have revived interest in Pacific islands infrastructure.
 
 At the same time as the Luganville wharf was being constructed, Japan was also demonstrating its friendship by building a major wharf in the capital, Port Vila. The US$70m project came with much more favourable terms.
 
 Australia, meanwhile, signed on to fund a US$30m urban infrastructure development project in the capital. The World Bank has already committed US$60m to the nation’s airports, and is reportedly considering upping the ante to US$150m.
 
 Despite the fact that Australia remains the largest donor in Vanuatu and the Pacific, analysts suggest that China has stolen a march on it by ingratiating itself with politicians who see infrastructure projects as vote getters.
 
 It is widely felt that Chinese engagement lacks coherence, and that the quality of its work is variable – to be generous. But nobody doubts Beijing’s popularity with the political elite, and that should cause concern in Canberra.
 
 Locally, engagement between Australian development workers and their government counterparts is excellent. But communication between Pacific capitals and Canberra is sadly lacking. Ill-considered comments, such as Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells’ January diatribe about Chinese “roads going nowhere”, play poorly in the Pacific. They only offer China an opportunity to commiserate with local officials and to go on quietly building roads and wharves.","['pacific', 'military', 'projects', 'chinese', 'officials', 'talk', 'bank', 'misses', 'baseless', 'development', 'infrastructure', 'rumours', 'point', 'vanuatu', 'china', 'australia', 'installation', 'world']","{'Australia': 7, 'China': 5, 'Japan': 1, 'United States': 8, 'Vanuatu': 8}",,,,,

 The multi-billion dollar Belt and Road initiative, led by China, is a plan to create a massive economic zone connecting Asia, Europe and Africa through a network of roads, ports, bridges, tunnels and pipelines. The plans, which include deep water ports in the Arctic, could involve 70 nations and two-thirds of the world’s population.
 
 The initiative was launched in 2013 and so far Europe has been wary of it, while UK seems to be ignoring it. However, investments linked to it are happening. Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, is investing in a high-tech rail system, built by the Chinese, who also plan to build a high-speed railway in Thailand by 2021. The Chinese-built high speed railway between Mombasa and Nairobi opened this year and there are plans to extend it further into Africa’s hinterland. And a massive bridge linking Hong Kong and Macau will open later this year.

 There is also huge infrastructure spending in China itself, as part of the initiative. By 2020, the country’s highway expressway network will increase from 74,000km to 139,000km, rail lines from 91,000km to 120,000km and the number of airports from 175 to 240.

 China is not the only country investing in transport infrastructure, Despite already having a superb transport system, Singapore continues to spend 12.5% of the government’s annual income on transport. The equivalent figure for the UK for the next five years is less than 2% and the effects of continued under-investment are evident.
 
 Four of the 10 worst airports in the world are in the UK (Gatwick, Stansted, Manchester and Edinburgh), for instance. The new HS2 lines will not reach Crewe until 2027, and won’t get to Manchester or Leeds until 2033. The M6 is hopelessly overloaded, while the business case for the proposed upgrade of the key trans-Pennine route between Sheffield and Manchester, with its mile-long queues for much of the day, was proposed in 1960 and is hopelessly out of date. It assumes traffic growth of only 3-6% in four years, below the forecast economic growth.
 
 But the Belt and Roads initiative is about much more than transport. The economic centre of gravity of Eurasia is moving eastwards. Singapore is having serious discussions with the Chinese government about how best to engage with it and is supporting its businesses to set up in China.
 
 The UK must follow suit, including urgently and massively revitalising its infrastructure so that all parts of the country, not just the south-east, can engage with these huge markets. So far, the UK’s preparations and infrastructure spending plans look hopelessly inadequate.

 China has done a ton of building in the developing world.
 
 Over the past two decades, it has financed and built bridges, hospitals, roads, railways, airports and seaports — many billions of dollars' worth and counting. ""China has recently become a major financier of economic infrastructure,"" according to a new report from AidData, a development finance research lab based at the College of William & Mary.
 
 That sounds like a good thing. But there are skeptics.
 
 Development experts and Western politicians have raised many questions: What is China's goal in building all this? Are these projects well-constructed? And are they actually beneficial?
 
 Now the AidData team at the College of William & Mary is using night lights to shed some light on that last question.
 
 In recent years, China has been very clear about its ambitions to expand trade and influence via infrastructure and investments in other countries. They call it the ""Belt and Road Initiative."" But nearly everything else about China's development strategy — its spending, projects and project locations — is officially a state secret.
 
 That shroud of secrecy has bolstered a popular narrative that China is a ""rogue donor"" that pours money into undemocratic governments to promote Chinese growth and access to natural resources. Skeptics say the Chinese projects are of little use to the countries, often in Africa, where they're built. Politicians have described some of them as ""white elephant"" projects. They point to seaports, bridges and other projects that cost a great deal to build but aren't actually getting a lot of use.
 
 It also doesn't help that there have been numerous accounts of shoddy construction: A road in Zambia washed away during the 2009 rainy season. A bridge in Kenya collapsed during construction in 2017. And a hospital in Angola was evacuated months after opening in 2010 for fear it would collapse.
 
 Development specialists say these accounts are concerning, yet some leaders of recipient countries still voice their preference for working with China. Their argument is that China is a ""one-stop shop,"" not only financing projects but building them as well. Often, it's cheaper and faster to work with China than with traditional donors, like the World Bank, and it comes with fewer strings attached, such as requirements to privatize the project once it's built.
 
 And now there's another point in China's favor. New research suggests that China's infrastructure projects may be better at reducing inequality in developing countries than many Western programs.
 
 ""It could be anecdotally true that a given project was a white elephant, but it isn't systematically true,"" says Bradley Parks, one of the study's authors and executive director of AidData.
 
 Parks says that according to his team's research, there is a strong correlation between Chinese projects and economic growth in the countries where they're built. He also says that Chinese-financed ""connective infrastructure"" — things that connect people from one place to another, such as roads, bridges, railways and ports — are distributing economic growth into rural areas more evenly than traditional Western development programs have. That's because China favors projects that connect people and businesses from rural, remote interior areas to bigger coastal cities, where there are more economic opportunities.
 
 The AidData team came to that conclusion after identifying and locating more than 4,400 Chinese development projects implemented in 138 countries between 2000 and 2014. They did so using online sources, like news articles, Chinese embassy websites and field research from academics and nongovernmental organizations.
 
 ""The Chinese government doesn't have a central data set that they share,"" Parks says. ""But there's a huge amount of information that is scattered across the Web.""
 
 Then they looked at nighttime satellite images from the U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System satellites. Parks says that it's ""reasonably well-established in [academic] literature"" that nighttime light is a good indicator of household income – more light means that families in that area have more money.
 
 The AidData researchers measured changes over time, starting back in 2000 and going up to 2013, in the amount of light visible within a certain distance from China's connective infrastructure. They found that in the later images, light was not just concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the projects, but it also had spread within the provinces and districts where they were built, as well as between provinces and districts. This, they say, suggests that Chinese connective infrastructure is spreading economic growth across large regions.
 
 Some researchers, though, say there's more digging to be done.
 
 ""There is no doubt that many Chinese investments have had a positive impact, regardless of how short-lived,"" says Jacqueline Muna Musiitwa, an international lawyer based in East Africa. ""That said, it is important to determine [definitively] if incomes are increasing, what money is being spent on and whether quality of life is improving. It is not enough to look at economic growth figures, because they do not adequately tell the story at the micro-level or change our daily engagement with poverty.""
 
 Johannes Urpelainen, director and professor of energy, resources and environment at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies says he thinks the study is ""a good step forward"" and consistent with what other research has shown about the potential of infrastructure to reduce inequality.
 
 ""The next step would be to collect more detail on what's actually happening in these communities,"" Urpelainen says — for example, if any factors, other than household income, are contributing to more light. ""It's a very big challenge, but that seems to be the most important next step.""
 
 Parks agrees that their measures of light ""could also capture other aspects of human development, including local health and education outcomes."" But, he says, even if it does include other factors, finding a relationship between connective infrastructure and those results – including reduced inequality – is ""still good news.""

 Chinese President Xi Jinping is ready for a change — specifically the transformation of the international system and China's role within it. In a 2016 speech before government ministers and provincial leaders, Xi provided an early signal of his intent: ""China has become a major factor in changing the world political and economic landscapes. ... We need to work harder to turn our economic strength into international institutional authority.""
 
 To date, however, Xi has avoided taking the United States head-on in competition for global leadership. There is little evidence that he desires the responsibility such leadership entails; the world has yet to hear, for example, a Chinese proposal to meet the challenge of global terrorism, the refugee crisis or even climate change. Xi's approach instead has been to work to erode the foundational pillars of U.S. leadership — its alliances, the values and norms upheld by international institutions and its development model — and supplant them with ones more supportive of Chinese interests. In this context, the U.S.-China trade conflict might be understood as merely one battle in a protracted ground war over values, principles and global leadership.
 
 In the current global balance of power — sustained by both the relative distribution of global wealth and the system of U.S.-led alliances — the United States remains the dominant player (although less so than at any time in the recent past).
 
 Rather than a frontal assault on U.S. leadership, Xi has articulated his vision of a ""community of shared destiny,"" which is premised on mutual cooperation, fairness and equality — a ""new"" approach that ""supersedes"" an outdated Western model. While benign-sounding, this community concept means nothing less than the end of the U.S.-led system of alliances. As one Chinese official told me, such alliances are ""anachronistic"" and ""not suitable for the contemporary time.""
 
 The shaky commitment of President Trump to America's alliance structures has provided welcome support to Chinese diplomats and scholars tasked with selling Xi's idea. Nonetheless, the Chinese leader has undermined his own soft sell with his military assertiveness in the South China Sea and willingness to adopt coercive economic policies toward South Korea and Taiwan, among other nations.

 Xi also is working to reform international institutions and norms to reflect the interests of the Chinese government. Beijing's diplomats are adeptly exploiting the United Nations and other organizations to try to diminish the relative weight of individual freedoms and liberties in human rights discourse and promote Internet sovereignty, as opposed to the free flow of information. China's grand-scale Belt and Road infrastructure initiative has become a test case for the norms underpinning China's development path, which discount the importance of good governance in pursuit of rapid economic development. While many countries eagerly court Belt and Road projects, many others are now rejecting them, fearful of the potential negative environmental, financial and social ramifications.
 
 Finally, China has dramatically increased the resources it puts toward public diplomacy, providing generous scholarships for foreign students and officials to study the China model, opening government-sponsored centers to advance understanding of Chinese language and culture, and launching a media campaign to shape the Chine narrative.
 
 Officials in some developing countries appreciate China's emphasis on infrastructure-led growth, foreign investment and political stability. The Tanzanian minister of transport and communications found China's censorship practices worthy of emulation: ""Our Chinese friends have managed to block such media in their country and replaced them with their homegrown sites that are safe, constructive and popular. We aren't there yet, but ... we should guard against their misuse.""
 
 In addition, Beijing is not only advancing its own positive China narrative but also moving to prevent others from providing a contrary one. After a Chinese company took a significant stake in a South African newspaper, for example, a writer found his column canceled after publishing an article criticizing China's repression in the Western autonomous region of Xinjiang. And in Kenya, the Chinese government subsidized digital television access for 800 villages, providing extensive Chinese programming while ensuring that other international stations, such as the BBC and Al Jazeera, were priced out of reach. Some Chinese analysts now boast about the positive relationship between ""not free"" political systems and economic prosperity.
 
 The United States should not fear the China model or Xi's promotion of it. It is not, in the end, an inherently resilient or attractive system. The environmental, health and demographic challenges are well-known. There are serious and rising levels of household, corporate and government debt. And ongoing protests from many sectors of society — including feminists, workers, students, pensioners and retired members of the military — suggest deep pockets of discontent. As one European China scholar has noted, ""Never have I seen such a successful country in which so many people who benefit the most all want to leave.""
 
 Yet neither can Washington afford to ignore Xi and his efforts to remake the international system. The administration needs to give life to its concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific: an affirmative message of the values inherent in liberal market democracies and a demonstration of those values at home, buttressed by a set of robust political, economic and security partnerships, and a commitment to international development premised on these principles. If the best the United States can do is complain, whine, and denounce China, it most certainly will lose not only the battles along the way, but also — and more importantly — the war.

 China, known as the world's biggest polluter, has been taking dramatic steps to clean up and fight climate change.
 
 So why is it also building hundreds of coal-fired power plants in other countries?
 
 President Xi Jinping hosted the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing over the weekend, promoting his signature foreign policy of building massive infrastructure and trade links across several continents.
 
 The forum, attended by leaders and delegates of nearly 40 countries, came amid growing criticism of China's projects, including their effect on the environment.
 
 Xi took the highly unusual step, for him, of meeting with international journalists, during which he repeated the slogan that he is committed to ""open, clean and green development.""

 Yet China's overseas ventures include hundreds of electric power plants that burn coal, which is a significant emitter of the carbon scientifically linked to climate change. Edward Cunningham, a specialist on China and its energy markets at Harvard University, tells NPR that China is building or planning more than 300 coal plants in places as widely spread as Turkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Egypt and the Philippines.
 
 Days before the forum with its ""clean and green"" theme, the latest Chinese-built coal plant opened in Pakistan.

 The plants are significant investments at a time when most nations of the world, including China, have committed to fighting climate change. ""When you put money down and put steel into the ground for a coal-fired power plant,"" says Cunningham, ""it's a 40- or 50-year commitment.""
 
 In one sense, China's push for coal is not surprising: China knows how to build coal plants. It is the world's largest coal consumer, drawing more than 70 percent of its electricity from coal, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

 But facing overwhelming pollution levels, China has restrained the growth of its coal industry — at home.
 
 For many years, four huge electric power plants burned coal within the capital city, Beijing, contributing to the city's choking smog. But within the past four years, all four stopped burning coal.
 
 A visit by NPR on Saturday to one of the plants, the Huaneng Beijing thermal power station, showed that it now burns natural gas — still a contributor to climate change but overall considered cleaner.
 
 ""The air quality is much better than before,"" said Ma Fei, who owns Kelaicai restaurant near the power plant. ""[It's] much better for my health.""

 While closing old plants, China's leaders have limited the building of new ones. The government has promoted wind and solar energy — it has produced so many solar panels that it has reduced prices for them worldwide, which analysts contend has contributed to the spread of solar energy in the United States.
 
 But the Chinese engineers, metalworkers and laborers who built coal-fired power plants must be kept employed. And, Cunningham says, ""many are going abroad."" They are building energy projects for developing nations, largely as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative.
 
 China has made more than $244 billion in energy investments abroad since 2000, much of it in recent years, according to a Boston University database. The bulk is in oil and gas, but more than $50 billion has gone toward coal. A report in January found that more than one-quarter of coal plants under development outside China have some commitment or offer of funds from Chinese financial institutions.
 
 ""China has done a very good job of emphasizing the target of greening the Belt and Road,"" said Courtney Weatherby, a Southeast Asia analyst at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C. ""But it's not clear when you look at the actual projects that China is funding that they are truly green.""

 ""I think that is where many of us are concerned,"" said Harvard's Cunningham, who attended the recent forum and has been invited back by Chinese officials to speak to academic panels in the country. ""For every large solar farm that is being built or wind farm that is being built [by China], there are also significant investments going into the fossil [fuel] side. ... There's only one climate ... and we're obviously all carbon constrained.""
 
 And there are concerns beyond climate. The coal projects in developing nations are built with Chinese loans, which the developing states must repay. There is a widespread view among investors that as the coal industry declines in much of the world, coal is a bad investment.
 
 The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Chinese-founded international institution based in Beijing, told NPR that it applies rigorous standards to its investments and has yet to support a coal-fired power plant anywhere. ""In most countries today, it doesn't really make financial economic sense anymore to invest in coal-fired power plants,"" said bank Vice President Joachim von Amsberg. Renewable energy offers a cleaner alternative.

 Chinese officials were ready to answer such concerns at their Belt and Road Forum. ""We're not intending to transfer pollution to other countries,"" said Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing. ""We're trying to create development opportunities.""
 
 In neighboring Vietnam — a country highly dependent on coal — China is a major investor in the energy sector. China is involved in 15 coal power plants in operation, six under construction and at least two in the planning stages, according to Nguyen Thi Hang with Hanoi-based environmental group Green Innovation and Development Centre. ""China's investments in Vietnam is both good and bad but it is also coupled with negative impacts on people's health and livelihoods,"" Nguyen said.
 
 There is still a question of how to supply energy sustainably. If China falls short, Chinese officials at least know they can expect scant criticism on coal investments from the U.S. government. President Trump's administration has also been promoting coal.

 Little disturbs the serenity of Guan Yin, the bodhisattva of compassion, as her statue sits in contemplation at the centre of Mattala Rajapaksa international airport.
 
 The last flight from the airport departed at 7.50am. The next is scheduled for 7.50am tomorrow. In the meantime check-in counters are empty, car rental desks deserted, and the only sign of life a handful of staff laughing around an information desk who disperse when a visitor arrives.
 
 
 
 Built to handle one million passengers each year, Mattala Rajapaksa saw just over 50,000 people in 2017. Since it opened four years ago the gleaming facility in Hambantota district, on Sri Lanka’s south coast, has become known as the emptiest international airport in the world.

 It is a symbol of the promise and peril of a fierce contest under way in south Asia. While most international attention has been focused on the South China Sea, on its western border China has been aggressively expanding its presence in the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh – rattling the regional kingpin, India, and watched warily by the west.
 
 China’s clout has few limits. Shouldn’t we be worried about its new Silk Road? | Tom Miller Read more
 
 “China’s penetration of south Asia is the biggest game changer in 100 years,” says Constantino Xavier, a fellow at the thinktank Carnegie India. “The Russians tried, the Americans tried. This is the first time since at least world war two you have a massive power contesting the Indian state.”
 
 
 
 Chinese money has gushed into south Asia and especially Pakistan in the past decade, and billions more has been promised as part of the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing’s ambitious bid to create a new Silk Road of trade routes around the world.
 
 In the Maldives the Chinese government or state-owned enterprises have provided loans or investment for more than 20 projects, according to new analysis by thinktank Gateway House, with the largest three projects alone worth nearly 40% of the Maldivian GDP.
 
 
 
 Nepal, which shares an open border with India, is hosting at least two dozen Chinese investments. Beijing’s interests in Bangladesh are estimated to be worth up to $35bn. But few regions in the neighbourhood have been transformed as dramatically as Hambantota, about five hours’ drive from the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo.
 
 Surrounded by acres of paddy fields and banana trees, between fishing villages and food stalls, enormous pieces of modern infrastructure now line the Hambantota landscape. They are ghostly sites. More cows than cars ply a new expressway. A convention centre that hosted the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in 2013 now offers cheap rates to wedding parties. A newly built hospital has never admitted patients, instead providing accommodation to Chinese migrant workers.

 They were built in the fury of development that followed the end of the Sri Lankan civil war, fuelled by $8bn borrowed from China by the previous president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who dreamed of turning his ancestral home into a tourism and business powerhouse.
 
 “There was this sense that China would write us blank cheques,” says one Sri Lankan government economist, not authorised to speak publicly.

 The rates on Chinese loans were often no better than those on international capital markets, he says. The difference was China asked fewer questions. “There was no rigour applied to, how are you going to make this work, what’s the business model here?
 
 “It took a while for folks to realise we might be in trouble.”
 
 ‘An acute crisis’
 
 Not every Hambantota project is deserted. In 2010 Sri Lanka agreed to pay a Chinese state-owned corporation $1.5bn to build a new port. Last December, struggling to make repayments, the government agreed to lease the port – and 15,000 acres surrounding it – to the same Chinese company for 99 years.
 
 The lease has alarmed Indian and western policymakers who worry China has won a strategic foothold in the Indian Ocean. It has also angered locals, who fear Sri Lanka is caught in a debt trap and will be forced to lease even more assets in the future.
 
 On 9 December a Chinese flag was raised over Hambantota port in place of Sri Lanka’s. It lasted seven days. “I went to the port administration office and told them I was willing to be shot to take down this flag,” says Bergama Gnana Thilaka, the chief priest at a Buddhist temple near the site.
 
 Thilaka has led hundreds of monks in resistance to the lease of the port, which he likens to a colonial invasion. “When Sri Lanka was colonised by the British there were Buddhist monks who played a pivotal role against them,” he says.
 
 The presence of Chinese workers in Hambantota has particularly galled opponents, on a backdrop of raging Buddhist nationalist sentiment on the island. Thilaka complains he knows of at least five marriages already between Chinese workers and local women.
 
 “If they start coming here and have that much of an imprint, we will have a similar problem to what we’ve had with the upcountry Tamils,” he says. “There is no way to send these people back.”

 Watching on, analysts and western diplomats warn Chinese money is increasingly translating into political sway.
 
 “What has changed is the sheer amount of [Chinese] influence, and how they’re using this economic leverage for political and strategic purposes,” says Tanvi Madan, the director of the India project at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC.
 
 Mohamad Nasheed, the exiled former Maldives president, calls China’s involvement in his country an “acute crisis”, accusing it of propping up the current ruler, Abdulla Yameen, so it can keep acquiring territory in the archipelago. “They have weaponised foreign direct investment,” he says.
 
 Sri Lanka has banned the Chinese navy from Hambantota port for now, but faces decades of debt repayments to Beijing. “Any country that extends economic assistance, whether it’s China, India or the US, has a strategic interest in doing so,” says Dushni Weerakoon, the executive director at the Institute of Policy Studies in Colombo.
 
 Even in developed democracies such as Australia, governments are trying to adjust to more aggressive Chinese intervention, says Xavier, the Carnegie India fellow. “You can imagine what they can do with $24bn in Bangladesh in 10 years’ time.”
 
 
 
 Inevitably a more intense rivalry also increases the potential for military confrontation. India and China have fought wars over disputed borders in the past, but in 2017 for the first time they squared off on the soil of a third country, when Bhutan called Indian troops in to stop Chinese road-building in a disputed area.
 
 India is doubling down on courting its neighbours, Xavier says, but also China’s other rivals. Once described as “estranged democracies”, the US and India now boast closer ties than ever, and along with Japan and Australia have revived a high-level forum known as the “Quad”, aimed at ensuring the Indian and Pacific Ocean regions remain “free and open”.
 
 Neither India nor China is likely to ever completely dominate the region, Madan says. Instead, she predicts the small states will keep their powerful patrons guessing. “They will play one country against the other and try to maximise the benefits,” she says. “This is only going to become more complex, not less.”","['money', 'hambantota', '100', 'port', 'indian', 'game', 'chinese', 'changer', 'lanka', 'gushes', 'china', 'india', 'sri', 'biggest', 'international', 'south']","{'Australia': 2, 'Bangladesh': 3, 'Bhutan': 1, 'China': 14, 'India': 16, 'Japan': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 11, 'Maldives': 3, 'Nepal': 2, 'Pakistan': 1, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 Chen Zhu, a 46-year-old director of a Chinese shipping company in Karachi, Pakistan, was sitting in his car after finishing lunch. He had dispensed with his normal security since it was a public holiday, and his next task for the day was to buy some groceries.
 
 An unknown assailant crossed the road, approached Chen’s car and shot him nine times. He was declared dead soon after reaching hospital.
 
 The motive for what was clearly a pre-planned attack is not just of interest to the police and Zhu’s family. If it was a killing designed to threaten Karachi’s growing Chinese business community, it underlines how Pakistan’s decision to place so much of its economy in the hands of state investors from its much larger neighbour is resented by those who fear the country will become a de facto colony of China.

 The framework for the economic alliance is a deal known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) unveiled when Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, came to Pakistan in 2015. CPEC is a series of mainly Chinese-financed energy and infrastructure projects totalling upwards of $62bn in grants and soft loans – of which around $26bn is earmarked for power plants.
 
 The project is branded around the theme of connectivity: power stations, ports, dams, transmission lines, roads and fibre optic cables linking Pakistan to the Chinese internet. Among projects to be completed in 2018 are a mass-transit light railway in Lahore, and a coal-fired power plant in Karachi.
 
 Concerns over China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative have been expressed from Germany to Australia, but such worries do not find many echoes in Islamabad or Karachi, Pakistan’s largest port and commercial capital.
 
 Pakistan has taken a huge strategic bet with China, and few mainstream politicians are challenging this gamble, save to demand their region gets a larger slice of cash.
 
 Both military and civilians say this will be the Chinese century – and it is Pakistan’s good fortune to be in with China on the ground floor. The official rhetoric is all about “an all-weather friendship between iron brothers”.
 
 Muhammad Zubair, the governor of Sindh province and a close ally of Nawaz Sharif, the ousted prime minister, openly acknowledges the Chinese relationship is about more than economics.
 
 “It gives China the security leverage they desperately need,” he says. “Obviously they want to compete with America, and want to make as many friends as possible on the way. They see [that] Pakistan is already facing the might of India – and India is politically very close to America, so China has a clear room for manoeuvre via Pakistan. They have global ambitions, and we have been their friends long before anyone else.

 “My only question to CPEC’s critics is, if we had not done CPEC, what option were you proposing? Are you saying we should go to complete power blackouts and the country should go into the stone age? When someone says CPEC favours the Chinese far more than Pakistan, of course that is the case, but that will always be the case between a lender and a borrower.”
 
 The interior minister, Ahsan Iqbal, argues Pakistan had nowhere else to go. Saudi Arabia – to which the Pakistan military has just agreed to send another 1,000 troops – is the only alternative source of big cash.
 
 The benefits to China are readily apparent, says Zubair: “It is sitting on tonnes of cash and needs to invest it. We are the obvious country for political and geographical reasons.”

 In addition, Pakistan’s growing middle class represents a huge potential market for Chinese exports. Almost two-thirds of Pakistan’s 208 million people are aged under 30 and are driving demand in the fastest-growing retail market in the world.
 
 Pakistan’s still underdeveloped agricultural system is ripe for Chinese investment; China also wants to develop its western provinces, and needs a transit route via Pakistan to import energy and raw material from the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.
 
 But CPEC may yet disappoint Pakistan. Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistan ambassador to the US and one of America’s diminishing band of Pakistani friends, says China has a history of predatory lending in developing countries that may not bode well for Pakistan.
 
 In Sri Lanka, for example, China built a port at Hambantota but the revenues have been lower than expected and Sri Lanka has been unable to service the loans. In December, it agreed to hand the port over to two Chinese state-controlled entities.
 
 In Pakistan, China also has the upper hand in a relationship already accounting for 46% of Pakistan’s trade deficit.

 Sirajuddin Aziz, president of the Habib Metropolitan bank, warned that CPEC should not become a vehicle to exclude other international investors. Countries such as Japan already complain that their efforts to build infrastructure in Pakistan now meet with Chinese resistance.
 
 But the biggest question is whether Pakistan’s burgeoning defence relationship with China may one day extend to granting Beijing a military base on Pakistan’s soil – one from which China could intensify its strategic rivalry with India.
 
 Jiwani, about 50 miles (80km) west of the better-known Gwadar port in Balochistan, has been most frequently mentioned as a possible site.
 
 Gwadar’s great expectations
 
 Gwadar itself, currently a small dusty fishing town 300 miles from Karachi, is the centrepiece of CPEC. In effect owned by the Chinese for the next 40 years, it will provide China with access to the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea.
 
 After driving on a battered two-lane highway through scrub and past a scattered town, the road looks much like anywhere else in Balochistan, until the first signs emerge that one of the great economic gambles of Pakistan is drawing close: an increase in Pakistani police, then a convoy of Chinese luxury cars and finally the looming blue cranes of Gwadar port itself.
 
 The Chinese cars, with Chinese flags, escorted by gun-carrying guards, turn right up the hill towards a five-star hotel populated by Chinese that sits at the top of the cliff overlooking the port. Below by the water’s edge stand the eight huge newly installed cranes, a business centre, a container area and the so-called Chinatown, a web of huts containing the Chinese workers who are effectively running the biggest deep water port in the area. A short boat ride out from the docks with the port managers towards the Arabian Sea reveals the sheer scale of the enterprise.

 The director of marine operations, Captain Gul Muhammad, says the aim is to turn Gwadar into a city of one million people with the largest port in south Asia, two enterprise free-zones with 23-year tax holidays, liquified natural gas terminals with pipelines to Karachi (home to the largest international airport in Pakistan), and a multi-lane expressway heading north through Quetta and across 1,860 miles towards the Chinese border.
 
 “From here, we can transform Pakistan. It will happen sooner than people think,” Muhammad promises.

 The speed of the plans to transform a fishing port may appear fantastical until you compare pictures of cities such as Doha today and 30 years ago. Then the pace of development, especially under Chinese direction, seems quite achievable, even if, right now, mundane issues such as sufficient drinking water are occupying the planners.
 
 
 
 The local community – largely fishermen – fear being shut out of the development, and there seems to be an assumption that infrastructure investment is inherently a benefit. As Nawaz Sharif said during his visit to Gwadar in 2017 while he was still prime minister: “When roads are made, success follows.”

 Iron cannons installed by the Dutch to ward off colonial rivals still line Galle Face Green, a grassy, mile-long promenade along the Colombo seafront. Further out to sea, within range of the guns, a new world power is leaving its mark on Sri Lanka’s capital.
 
 Currently, Port City is just a flat expanse of blank land jutting out into the ocean, growing a fraction larger each day, as dredging ships pour what will eventually amount to 65 million cubic metres of sand.
 
 Within a few years, however, Port City will be the site of glass skyscrapers, a busy financial district, hospitals, hotels and even a theme park. Across the world, Chinese companies are developing President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative by building new roads, ports and bridges – but in Sri Lanka they are building a whole new metropolis.

 “It is a completely new city that will nearly double the size of Colombo right now,” says Janaka Wijesundara, a former director at Sri Lanka’s Urban Development Authority. “It is going to drastically change the entire landmass.”
 
 Built on 665 acres (2.6 sq km) of land being reclaimed from the Indian Ocean, the city is designed to be a smaller Singapore, with its own business-friendly tax regime and regulations – and possibly a different legal system to the rest of Sri Lanka.
 
 About 80,000 people are expected to live in the city, with another quarter of a million commuting in every day.
 
 Facebook Twitter Pinterest How will the burgeoning city affect the rest of Colombo? Photograph: Alamy
 
 It is the largest single foreign direct investment in Sri Lankan history – a $1.4bn (£1.1bn) project by the state-owned Chinese engineering firm China Communications Construction Company (CCCC).
 
 Artistic impressions of the future Port City show a brightly lit cityscape comparable to Dubai or London’s Canary Wharf. Developers say 1.5 million sq metres of office space will be available and private investment could reach $13bn. Dense high-rises give way to lower-slung residential areas, crisscrossed by parks and canals. A marina and beach line the city’s edges.
 
 It is a world away from the fading bungalows, modest temples and low-slung towers of present-day Colombo. But designers say they have striven to have the new city reflect its roots, according to Daniel Ringelstein, a director at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), the firm that created the masterplan for the city’s central business district.
 
 
 
 “We took inspiration from the colonial era,” he says, highlighting Colombo’s whitewashed colours, elegant arcades and “individually expressed, vertically proportioned buildings” as key influences.
 
 The mega-blocks initially favoured by the developers were subdivided by the firm, he says, to create more walkable public space, mimicking the vivid street life of Sri Lankan cities and including an emphasis on natural shade.
 
 The idea to expand Colombo’s business district outward on to land reclaimed from the sea was first proposed in 2004. The city, located along key shipping routes across the Indian Ocean, had been a hub for trade for more than 2,000 years.
 
 But a bloody, 25-year civil war was killing thousands of people each year. Around the time authorities were mulling an early version of Port City, Colombo was struck by its first suicide bombing since 2001. The plans were shelved for five years.

 By 2009, the war had been brought to a close, thanks to ruthless offensives by the Sri Lankan army. Then-president Mahinda Rajapaksa declared Sri Lanka open for business – but the spectre of what the UN calls “horrific” human rights abuses committed by both the army and the Tamil Tigers continued to ward off most investors.
 
 One major country, however, was happy to fund Sri Lanka’s reconstruction. “China offered political cover for Sri Lanka towards the end of the war and had already started to play more of a prominent role on the economic front,” says Dushni Weerakoon, the executive director at the Institute of Policy Studies in Colombo. “After the war ended, it all just accelerated.”
 
 The project is totally harmful to tourism and totally harmful to fishermen W Jude Namal Fernando, trade unionist
 
 In total, Rajapaksa borrowed about $8bn from China, much of which was spent on big-ticket infrastructure in his ancestral home district of Hambantota – which has since become a byword for the risks associated with Chinese loans. A major new airport in Hambantota receives just one flight each day. A new hospital serves as accommodation for Chinese guest workers. Attracting most scrutiny is a port that was upgraded using money borrowed from China. Earlier this year, unable to afford the repayments, Sri Lanka handed control of the port to a subsidiary of CCCC for at least 99 years.
 
 The loans are part of a wave of Chinese investment in south Asia that has been described as “the biggest game changer in 100 years”, posing a serious challenge to India, the traditional power in the region.
 
 In 2014, concerns over Chinese loans and corruption played a key part in Rajapaksa’s shock election defeat. The new government promised to rebalance Sri Lanka’s relationship with India, Japan and the west. Though Port City was being funded by foreign investment, rather than a loan, it became a victim of the backlash: the new prime minister, Ranil Wickramasinghe, shelved the project, claiming the dredging would destroy Colombo’s coast.

 It was a win for environmentalists such as Hemantha Withanage, who heads the Colombo-based Centre for Environmental Justice (CJE). “The project is totally harmful to tourism and totally harmful to fishermen,” he says.
 
 W Jude Namal Fernando, a fisherman and trade unionist in Negombo, north of Colombo, says the excavation of sand along the coast is destroying aquatic life and affecting the livelihoods of approximately 8,000 people who make a living from fishing. “The habitat belonging to various species has been demolished,” he says. “Corals have been removed, disturbing the ecological balance. And the fisheries industry consists of many others apart from fishermen – the livelihood of those who are on the shore and those who transport the catch to the market are also affected.”
 
 What is China's Belt and Road Initiative? Read more
 
 The CJE argues that building the new city will require more natural resources than Sri Lanka can sustainably provide. The necessary sand alone would quickly exceed 100 million cubic metres, it says, threatening a fragile marine habitat and the livelihoods of 15,000 fishermen who work in the mining area. The CJE prices the value of the sand at $3.2bn, which it says outweighs the $1.4bn invested by CCCC subsidiary China Harbour in building the city.
 
 The environmental group also warns commutes into the new financial district will add 300,000 daily car journeys, increasing airborne pollution in a city already exceeding World Health Organisation guidelines.
 
 Yet about a year after suspending Port City, in March 2016 the new government announced work would soon resume. CCCC had been claiming to be losing $380,000 each day the project was on hold, and was threatening to sue for compensation. The government says its amended contract with the Chinese firm includes new environmental protections. In an attempt to ease Indian concerns, 20 hectares of Port City originally slated to be given to CCCC in perpetuity was instead granted on a freehold basis. The trucks and dredgers returned. Within two years, Port City was back on schedule, with land reclamation expected to finish by the end of 2018 and the first buildings expected to appear within four years.
 
 Port City will be a separate entity where only a certain class of people will live Janaka Wijesundara, ex-director Urban Development Authority
 
 As the project takes shape, key questions about how Port City will operate remain unanswered. The new contract has not been released to the public. Sri Lanka has promised its Chinese investors favourable tax rates and business-friendly regulations, but it may be limited in what it can provide, thanks to an IMF loan the country took in 2016 to help pay its debts. Sri Lankan ministers have also said Port City will operate under a separate “British-style” legal system – but what that will entail is unclear. Several requests were made to the government to clarify, with no response.
 
 Sri Lankan activists have also raised questions about the power China Harbour will wield in the territory it leases in Port City, where it will effectively act as the landlord – a majority state-owned Chinese corporation deciding who can populate parts of a Sri Lankan city, and under what circumstances.

 Urban planners say another issue is unresolved: how the burgeoning city will affect the rest of Colombo. “That was the missing piece to the brief,” says Ringelstein. “How is this city connected to the historic city centre back to the east?”
 
 SOM’s masterplan tried to resolve the problem by creating patches of green space in Port City that will provide views of Colombo. They also encouraged the government to regenerate the western edge of the old city, creating a frontage that looks out on the new one.

 “The idea is to use green space as a way to mediate between the old and the new,” Ringelstein says. “You would hate for this new project to suck the life out of the existing city today.”
 
 Wijesundara, the former Urban Development Authority director, says developers may not even want to establish links between the old and new cities. “I will say that Port City will be a separate entity where only a certain class of people will live,” he says. “Services may be provided by the local people, but the money coming to them is questionable.”

 For much of the 20th century, the city of Duisburg in Germany’s industrial west was a steel-and-coal town whose chimneys cloaked the skies in smoke. And yet there is something about this soot-stained spot in the Ruhr valley that seems to encourage a particularly clear-sighted view of the rest of the world.
 
 We could become China’s gateway to Europe – and vice versa Mayor Sören Link
 
 In 1585, it was in Duisburg that Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator published a book of maps of European countries – the first ever “atlas” to carry that name. And it was here that Mercator first presented his new world map, the “Mercator projection”, that was so revolutionary for maritime navigators keen to steer merchant vessels across the high seas in the straightest possible line.
 
 If in 2018 Duisburg is slowly rediscovering its cosmopolitan past, it is not just because four centuries after Mercator, traders are still trying to find the most direct route from A to B. As the threat of Donald Trump’s tariffs and Brexit-related trade barriers is driving wedges between the EU and the Anglosphere, this former rust-belt town town allows one to see in real time how Germany and China are intensifying their economic ties.

 Every week, around 30 Chinese trains arrive at a vast terminal in Duisburg’s inland port, their containers either stuffed with clothes, toys and hi-tech electronics from Chongqing, Wuhan or Yiwu, or carrying German cars, Scottish whisky, French wine and textiles from Milan heading the other way.
 
 In Duisburg’s port, where train tracks run straight to the edge of the Rhine River, goods are loaded straight on to ships, stored for further dispatch in one of several football pitch-sized storage units, or sent on by train or truck to Greece, Spain or Britain.

 Duisburg was already regarded as the world’s largest inland port. But thanks to the Belt and Road infrastructure project – a revival of the Silk Road route that Mercator had read about in the travelogues of Marco Polo, this time subsidised with billions of dollars by the Chinese government – the port is fast becoming Europe’s central logistics hub. Around 80% of trains from China now make it their first European stop, with most using the northern silk road route via Khorgos on the China-Kazakhstan border and the Russian capital, Moscow.
 
 How Duisburg connects to the Belt and Road How Duisburg connects to China’s Belt (red) and Road (blue) routes.
 
 Local politicians, while still proud of the city’s links to the 16th-century mapmaker, also like to compliment the perceptive eye of modern Chinese cartographers: in a map of Europe displayed at Shanghai airport, they point out, Duisburg’s name is printed larger than London, Paris or Berlin.
 
 “We are Germany’s China city,” says Sören Link, Duisburg’s Social Democrat mayor. For years, his city has been a symbol of the challenges of long-term structural changes facing industry in the Ruhr region: in 1987, photographs of thousands of Krupp steelworkers barricading a bridge over the Rhine protesting against imminent factory closures travelled around the world.
 
 In 2018, Duisburg’s unemployment rate of 12% is still almost four times as high as the German average, but at least the viral images are different: four years ago the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, made Duisburg one of the few stops on his state visit to Germany and was welcomed by an orchestra playing traditional mining songs. “There are signs that the city’s importance will keep growing,” says Link. “We could become China’s gateway to Europe – and vice versa.”
 
 The trains’ return journeys, however, remain Duisburg’s achilles heel. For every two full containers arriving in Europe from China, only one heads back the other way, and the port only earns a fifth of the fee from empty containers that have to be sent back to China.

 And while the west’s appetite for gadgets made in China shows no sign of abating, one of the main European products heading east is powdered milk – a result of low trust in domestic brands following a 2008 food safety scandal. If that trust returns, even fewer containers may be heading east from Duisburg.
 
 “The ratio used to be 4:1, so it has improved, but we still have an imbalance,” admits Erich Staake, the port’s CEO. A former TV channel manager, he is not shy to take credit for the entrepreneurial spirit of the port. Since taking charge in 1998, employment at Duisport has soared from 19,000 to 50,000.
 
 While other German port cities such as Hamburg run their harbour “like a landlord”, Staake says, Duisburg has worked to court new trade, modernising its logistics infrastructure and even setting up its own railway company. He is building a new 20,000 sq metre storage unit where China Railways will be able to neatly stack 2,000 containers.

 Staake’s aspiration doesn’t stop there. For Duisburg to permanently establish itself on the New Silk Road, he says, rail travel between China and Europe needs to outstrip other freight methods.
 
 “Rail freight between Chongqing and Duisburg is almost twice as expensive as shipping, but takes 12 days instead of 45. Air freight is at least twice as expensive as rail freight, but takes on average five days. If we can reduce lead times even further, below 10 days on average, then that opens up a lot more potential.”
 
 What’s good for Duisburg isn’t necessarily good for the world Jonas Schaible, T Online
 
 But in Germany, some have been quick to sound a note of caution. If the still-recovering industries in western Germany make themselves too reliant on China, they warn, it could provide economic leverage for an authoritarian regime that wants to project its geopolitical power into western Europe. “What’s good for Duisburg isn’t necessarily good for the world,” cautioned one recent article.
 
 For now though, China’s soft power barely registers in the region. The number of Chinese citizens living in the city has doubled in the past eight years – but from a low base of 568. The local Duisburg-Essen University houses a Confucius Institute and attracts the largest number of Chinese students in Germany, most of whom study engineering and economic sciences. They support a growing network of relatively authentic Asian fast food joints which now compete with the kebab houses introduced by a previous generation of migrants.

 The number of Chinese businesses in the city has risen, too – up 50% since Xi visited in 2014 – but, again, there are still only 90. Unlike other cities on the New Silk Road, the port remains German-run.
 
 The reasons journey times from China are still far too long, as Staake sees it, lie mainly with the heavily unionised rail companies in Europe rather than their counterparts in Asia: trains take on average six days to travel the 1,300km (800 miles) from Brest on the Polish-Belarusian border to Duisburg, while the 10,000km from Chongqing to Belarus is often completed in five-and-a-half days.

 “The Chinese and the Kazakhs drive thousands of kilometres a day, they really work hard. It’s ridiculous, really. Of course we are trying to work out why this is happening. You know how many train drivers’ unions we have, and the Poles are not much better,” says Staake.
 
 At the Duisburg city museum, visitors can still listen to the chants and jeers of the workers who went on strike over the closure of the steelworks in the 1980s and early 90s. A button hidden inside a wall made of original Ruhr valley coal triggers a recording. The modern Duisburg port with all its modern marvel, however, has yet to find its place in the city’s memory.
 
 In the entrance hall to the museum, a wall greets visitors with the words for “welcome” in the languages of all the migrant workers who have shaped the city, from Kurdish to Greek to Polish. For now, the Mandarin or Cantonese phrases for “welcome” do not feature.

 Inside a lavishly decorated casino where chandeliers hang from the ceiling, cigarette smoke lingers in the air and platters of mango are served to gamblers, a game of baccarat is getting heated. Cards are slammed down, $100 bills are brandished and the gathered crowd of Chinese tourists shout excitedly.
 
 This is not Las Vegas, nor is it Macau. It is Sihanoukville, a once-sleepy city in Cambodia that has become a ballooning enclave for Chinese-run casinos – despite gambling being banned. These towering skyscrapers and vast domed structures covered in flashing neon signs have transformed Sihanoukville beyond recognition in less than two years. It will have more than 70 of them by the end of 2018.
 
 Q&A Cities of the New Silk Road: what is China's Belt and Road project? Show Hide China’s Belt and Road Initiative is a huge, $1tn infrastructure project to better connect China – and Chinese goods – with the rest of the world. It is meant to be a 21st-century ""silk road"", made up of a ""belt"" of overland corridors (including roads, bridges and railways) and a maritime ""road"" of shipping lanes. Its wider ambitions are harder to pin down. Is it a bid by China for world domination, or simply a move to prop up Chinese companies at home? Is there a grand strategy, or is it just a rebranding of existing projects? In Cities of the New Silk Road we have endeavoured to find out, by exploring the project's tangible results so far – from the newly built city of Khorgos on the Kazakhstan border to Duisburg, dubbed “Germany’s China city”. Our correspondents have reported from the “next Dubai” rising out of the sea in Sri Lanka, the nascent port of Gwadar in a restive province of Pakistan, the sleepy Tanzanian village that could be transformed into Africa’s largest port, and more.

 As home to Cambodia’s only deep-water port – part of a vital trade route for President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road development initiative – the city has become a focal point for Chinese investment. Vast Chinese-run construction projects are visible across almost every area of the city and its high streets are now lined with majority-Chinese businesses and restaurants. Prime minister Hun Sen’s willing embrace of Chinese investment, unlike neighbouring countries Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam, has ensured Cambodia is at the core of belt and road plans in southeast Asia. The southern coast of Cambodia is now home to $4.2bn worth of power plants and offshore oil operations all owned by Chinese companies. Beyond Sihanoukville, belt and road money is financing a new highway to Phnom Penh and a bigger airport in the capital.

 The speed of development has left many locals unnerved. Some estimate that the Chinese make up almost 20% of the town’s population. Of the total number of foreign arrivals in 2017, nearly 120,000 were Chinese – an increase of 126% year-on-year. This fear has fuelled rising hostility among locals towards the new influx of Chinese residents. The two communities live side-by-side in Sihanoukville but rarely interact.

 Sitting outside her family restaurant and guesthouse in Otres beach, 23-year-old Deu Dy gestures with concern to the huge Chinese resort complex being built next door. It has gone up in less than a year, with construction 24 hours a day.
 
 “Everything has changed in Sihanoukville in just two years,” says Dy, who is learning Chinese to try to integrate better with the city’s new community. “Before it was really quiet here, but not any more with all the Chinese construction. I am worried that it’s very destructive to the environment, all this building … and what will happen when all the construction is finished and thousands more people come? There will be no Cambodia left in Sihanoukville.”

 Like many local business owners in the city, she is regularly approached by Chinese investors wanting to buy her inn and offering her very good money. It is tempting, now she says that her family’s profits have collapsed: the 24-hour construction next door has driven away their European customers, while Chinese tourists prefer to stay in Chinese-run hotels and resorts.
 
 While not directly funded by Belt and Road money, the casinos and condo complexes are a byproduct of a city that has given itself over entirely to Chinese investment. Of the $1.3bn (£1bn) invested in Sihanoukville over the past year, $1.1bn has come from China. Chinese casino owners have also taken advantage of the nonexistent gambling regulation and lax money-laundering laws to set up an empire that is accessible only to foreigners – because gambling is still illegal for Cambodian locals.

 Many of the new Chinese businesspeople arriving in Sihanoukville are here to take advantage of a new China-Cambodia tax-free economic zone. The majority of the 100-plus factories in the zone are run by Chinese companies, and a further 200 mainly Chinese companies - producing consumer goods and garments – will be part of its ongoing expansion. A four-lane highway is being built by a Chinese construction company to connect Sihanoukville to Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh.

 For the locals, this ongoing transformation is divisive. Some are benefiting from an influx of money the city has never seen before, but many are being driven out by the skyrocketing cost of living.
 
 Kong Samol, 32, a tuk-tuk driver, is one of those losing out. “Because of all the Chinese businessmen here, my expenses have gone up but my earnings have gone down,” he says. “My rent has increased from $50 to $150 and it’s unaffordable for me. The owner wants to kick me out of my room so he can rent it to the Chinese who will pay so much more than I can afford. I know so many people who came here for work but have moved back to their villages because rent is impossible now.”
 
 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sihanoukville has changed dramatically in two years.
 
 Hemming clothes outside his sewing shop in the shadow of a new Chinese casino, Seng Lim Huon says Chinese investment is widening the divide between rich and poor. “The people who own the land here and have houses to rent, they can live bigger and bigger because they can earn so much more than before,” he says, adding that rooms he would once rent out for $500 per month to local residents now go for $4,500 to Chinese visitors. “But for people who don’t own land, it is a terrible situation.”
 
 Svay Sovana, 42, was among those overjoyed by Chinese investment in Sihanoukville. She used to earn $1,000 per month renting out a three-storey house to Europeans; she will earn $15,000 when her new Chinese tenants move in this month.
 
 The Chinese have much more money than Cambodians, and that means they have the power here now Srey Mach
 
 The transformation has also brought employment to the city. While a large number of Chinese workers have been brought in to staff casinos, there are also more jobs being offered to Cambodians, who earn between $120 and $200 a month (considered decent wages). Cambodian workers on Chinese construction sites earn three times what they used to on local projects.
 
 More grandiose and divisive projects are cropping up by the day. This week saw the announcement of a new $1bn joint Chinese-Malaysian-run Sihanoukville resort Wisney World, which will feature water parks, hotels, casinos, malls, gardens and churches across 65 hectares of land. In a sign of the disconnect between Chinese investors and those in local government, Sihanoukville’s provincial governor, Yun Min, said he had never even heard of the project.
 
 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Chinese investment has brought wealth to the city – but it hasn’t reached the whole community.
 
 Sihanoukville is no stranger to foreign investment. Before the Chinese it was the Russians who pumped money into local resorts and restaurants. The relationship is memorialised by a large, fading billboard outside an abandoned resort building site, which pictures long-serving Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen shaking Vladimir Putin’s hand.
 
 However, the key complaint for many in Sihanoukville is that even though Chinese investment brings wealth, it is mainly kept within their own community. Chinese residents and visitors buy from Chinese businesses and visit Chinese restaurants and hotels, ensuring the trickle-down effect is minimal.

 “Chinese products are very expensive, it is not good for us, and the Chinese buy only Chinese goods so we are very separate,” says Srey Mach, 43, shredding morning glory outside her shop while the sound of construction thunders all around. “Even the vegetables and fruits they export from China. The Chinese have money, much more money than the Cambodians, and that means they have the power here now.”
 
 As one of south-east Asia’s poorest countries, suffering from basic power and sanitation issues, Cambodia has welcomed the hefty cheques, soft loans and infrastructure plans from China with open arms. Between 2013 and 2017, China invested $5.3bn in the country – that’s more money than the Cambodian government did. Cambodia’s reliance on China has become even more pronounced in recent months after the US and EU pulled funding in the light of recent authoritarian political measures.
 
 The speed at which money is pouring in has also left local authorities in Sihanoukville with little time and resources to create regulation to manage either the dark underbelly of the Chinese casinos – sophisticated financial crime and money laundering – or the growing local discontentment.

 Locals seethe when they discuss the problem of organised crime: there have been incidents of kidnappings as well as an increase in drink-driving accidents and prostitution. Earlier this year, the regional governor complained that the crime rate in the province was increasing, in part due to an influx of “Chinese mafia [who] disguise themselves to commit various crimes and kidnap Chinese investors … causing insecurity in the province”.
 
 Yet with so much at stake in Cambodia, the Chinese are equally keen for the tide not to turn against Belt and Road. Sihanoukville is at the heart of this.

 “The image of China in Cambodia has been affected by what’s happened in Sihanoukville,” says Vannarith Chheang, co-founder of the Cambodian Institute for Strategic Studies. “I think the Chinese government and the Chinese embassy accepts there is rising anti-China rhetoric in Cambodia.”
 
 Highlighting ongoing negotiations between the two governments in an effort to tackle crime and local ill feeling, he adds: “It is important for China to win the hearts of the Cambodian people. If China fails in Cambodia it will fail in the region.”

But the significance of this move is global – and it concerns Europe in many ways. China has identified a “window of historic opportunity” for itself across the world. To make the best of this, so its logic goes, the country must be united and disciplined under a strong leader and supreme commander. Xi has been compared with Mao Zedong in that he’s created an entirely leader-centric political system – but to think this has consequences only for China risks missing the wider picture.
 
 In my country, the Czech Republic, we’ve seen up close how China intends to expand its reach. Central Europe is very much part of China’s ambition to “move to the centre of the world stage” – the expression used by Xi during last year’s Communist party congress. The basic tool China relies on is the Belt and Road initiative, a trade and infrastructure project spanning Asia and Europe which encapsulates the regime’s overarching foreign policy goals, in what Xi has dubbed the “new era”.
 
 The $900bn question: What is the Belt and Road initiative? Read more
 
 The Belt and Road initiative is often misunderstood in Europe, not least because it keeps changing its name from one confusing moniker to another. Originally called the New Silk Road in 2013, it soon changed its name to One Belt, One Road, only to be rebranded as Belt and Road, apparently because the word “one” sounded unduly hegemonistic. While layers of propaganda often make it impenetrable to outside observers, its impact is very real – and growing. The project has been showcased with pompous rhetoric and music videos, and more than 60 countries have agreed to join.
 
 But how has it affected us Czechs? I run a project that monitors China’s attempts to build its “smart” power through a nexus of business, political and media networks. In Europe, there’s arguably no fonder ally of Beijing than the Czech president, Miloš Zeman, a populist who was re-elected earlier this year. He is on record calling Xi his “young friend”, and Belt and Road “the most remarkable initiative in modern human history”.
 
 A tipping point came in 2014 when the Czech government proclaimed that the country would aspire to become “China’s gateway to Europe”. This amounted to a major foreign policy change. It broke entirely with the pro-democracy principles and support for Chinese dissidents of Václav Havel, the hero of the 1989 Velvet Revolution who went on to become president. Havel saw clear parallels between the past struggles of dissidents behind the iron curtain in Europe, and those of contemporary Chinese dissidents – in particular the Nobel peace prize winner Liu Xiaobo, whose Charter 08 declaration was directly inspired by Charter 77, the Czechoslovak anti-communist movement.

 With Zeman, the contrast couldn’t be starker. Here was the Czech Republic displaying total complacency about a regime that not only imprisoned Liu but denied him external medical help as his health dramatically deteriorated (he died last year). However, things went much further than just political signalling. By 2015, Zeman had named as his honorary adviser Ye Jianming, the chairman of a mysterious Chinese mega-company: CEFC, which had arrived in the Czech Republic promising billions of dollars of investments.
 
 CEFC embarked on what resembled a shock-and-awe buying spree, announcing it would scoop up stakes in travel services, an airline company, a brewery, a football club and a media group. It also lost no time hiring scores of former Czech elected officials, who often double as advisers at various ministries, or indeed within the presidential castle.
 
 CEFC’s main investments in the Czech Republic weren’t economic, they were about buying up the loyalty of Czech officials
 
 As time passed, however, actual investments remained negligible. The few deals that did materialise were mostly real estate acquisitions. Then last month, Ye suddenly ran into trouble in Beijing. News broke that he’d been arrested and come under investigation for financial irregularities. Prior to that, last November, the head of CEFC’s non-profit arm, the former Hong Kong politician Patrick Ho, was arrested in New York and accused of bribing presidents and government ministers in Africa.
 
 Ye’s disappearance obviously raised eyebrows in Prague. Zeman reacted by sending three close colleagues on a strange semi-private fact-finding mission to China. They came back with the information that the heavily indebted CEFC would effectively be taken over by the Chinese state, together with its Czech acquisitions. So much for the hopes that the company would save the Czech economy as a private investor.
 
 These awkward developments for Zeman have since prompted a debate about the wisdom of tying the country’s future to mysterious Chinese entities and to the Communist regime in Beijing.
 
 It might have helped to look more carefully before accepting Beijing’s embrace. Some of the metaphors Chinese media have attached to the Belt and Road project are revealing. They often call it “globalisation 2.0”, or the “New World Order”. What that vocabulary struggles to mask is that the whole endeavour is driven far more by politics than by markets.
 
 Deals are negotiated at state-to-state diplomatic summits. Open tenders are shunned. Contracts are awarded by political fiat. Ostensibly commercial companies put former politicians on their payrolls by the dozen. As it turns out, CEFC’s main investments in the Czech Republic weren’t economic, they were about buying up the loyalty of Czech officials. What China has to show for itself in my country is hardly innovation. Rather, it has brought us a new take on age-old crony capitalism.

 Speaking at the start of a high-profile summit about China’s “Belt and Road initiative”, Xi hailed his multi-billion dollar infrastructure crusade as a means of building a modern-day version of the ancient Silk Road and a new “golden age” of globalisation.
 
 The $900bn question: What is the Belt and Road initiative? Read more
 
 “The glory of the ancient Silk Road shows that geographical dispersion is not insurmountable,” he told the 29 heads of state who have gathered in Beijing for the event, including Russian president Vladimir Putin, and Turkey’s Recep Erdoğan.
 
 
 
 However, as Xi took to the stage his signature foreign policy initiative faced a backlash with India launching a scathing attack on the $900bn Chinese plan and announcing it would boycott proceedings. According to the the Times of India, New Delhi believed the scheme was “little more than a colonial enterprise [that would leave] debt and broken communities in its wake”.
 
 Xi told a different story on Sunday, painting what he called his “project of the century” as a bold and inclusive attempt to kickstart a new era of globalisation.
 
 In a 45-minute address, the Communist party chief vowed to throw his weight behind a global construction spree stretching all the way from Asia, across Europe and Africa, to the Americas.
 
 
 
 “The Belt and Road initiative is rooted in the ancient Silk Road ... but it is also open to all other countries,” the Chinese leader said, promising to pump $125bn into the scheme.
 
 Just as Chinese traders and explorers such as Zheng He, a Ming dynasty navigator, went out into the world in peace, so too would China now seek to engage with other countries. “These pioneers won their place in history not as conquerors with warships guns or swords but are remembered as friendly emissaries leading caravans of camels and sailing treasure-loaded ships,” Xi said.
 
 “This part of history shows that civilisation thrives with openness and that nations prosper from exchange.”

 Tom Miller, the author of a new book about the Belt and Road, said that in many countries the attitude to Xi’s infrastructure extravaganza was: “The more money the better”. And on Sunday morning, a cast of global leaders who are hoping to benefit from Beijing’s munificence lined up to heap praise on Xi Jinping.
 
 Ethiopia’s prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, hailed what he called a unique, historic, extraordinary and momentous project. “Many of us in the developing world – especially we in Africa – continue to view China as a successful economic model and a reliable ally in the fight against poverty and in our quest for prosperity,” he said, describing the Belt and Road as the greatest economic collaboration of the 21st century.

 The British chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: “I commend President Xi ... for setting in train such a bold and visionary project. This initiative is truly ground-breaking in the scale of its ambition, spanning more than 65 countries, across four continents, with the potential to raise the living standards of 70% of the global population.”
 
 
 
 One of the most resounding endorsements came from Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of key ally Pakistan, who told the audience he had come to offer his “deepest tributes” to Xi’s “seminal initiative”. “We stand at the cusp of a geo-economic revolution. In fact, this is the dawn of a truly new era of synergetic intercontinental cooperation,” Sharif said.
 
 
 
 Malaysia’s prime Minister, Najib Razak, tweeted his approval from the audience for the “visionary and exciting” initiative while Chile’s president, Michelle Bachelet, predicted it would “pave the way for a more inclusive, equal, just, prosperous and peaceful society with development for all”. “Chile is ready to become a bridge country between Asia and Latin America,” Bachelet said.
 
 However, there are also deep-rooted doubts, with some suspecting Beijing is using its “win-win” project as a ploy to lure less powerful nations into its economic orbit and boost its geopolitical power. Privately, western diplomats voice concerns about China’s true intentions and how much involvement non-Chinese companies will be allowed to have in Belt and Road projects. Only one G7 leader, the Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, is in Beijing for Xi’s summit.
 
 In a statement released on Saturday, India, the plan’s most vocal critic, cautioned China against pursuing projects that would create an “unsustainable debt burden for communities”, damage the environment or infringe upon other countries’ sovereignty. Such initiatives “must be based on universally recognised international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality”, it said.
 
 
 
 Beijing hit back at critics, with its official news agency attacking the “naysayers” and “fear mongers” it claimed were hovering over Xi’s plan like buzzards. The Belt and Road initiative was “not and will never be neocolonialism by stealth”, Xinhua argued in a commentary.
 
 
 
 “China harbours no intention to control or threaten any other nation. China needs no puppet states,” it added, describing the summit as a chance not “to assert a new hegemony, but an opportunity to bring an old one to an end”.
 
 Peter Cai, a fellow from Australia’s Lowy Institute, said the two-day forum was Xi’s latest attempt to burnish his credentials as a responsible world leader in a post-Trump, post-Brexit world. “The two strongest champions of globalisation as I see it – the US and the UK – are both retreating [genuinely] or symbolically from their commitment to globalisation ... I see this as presenting a good strategic opportunity for China to promote itself as the new champion of globalisation.”
 
 Cai said a Chinese construction blitz was good news for Asia, which suffers from a chronic deficit of infrastructure, but argued it was too early to tell whether Xi’s lofty dreams would be fulfilled. “Some projects are happening overseas but we are talking about multi-year infrastructure projects – some are just starting,” he said. “At this stage it is too early to pass judgment.”

 The Trump administration has shown unwavering support for the Israeli government, except for one major criticism: China's growing influence in the Israeli economy.
 
 Chinese companies have invested in strategic Israeli infrastructure, from shipping to electricity to public transportation, and they have bought up millions of dollars in stakes in cutting-edge technology startups.
 
 Where Israel sees an opportunity to access the world's second-largest economy, the United States sees security threats posed by its main adversary.
 
 ""For us in the United States, the long-term threat from China is the greatest national security threat we face,"" U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy John Rood told a security conference in Herzliya, Israel, this summer. ""China has tremendous ambitions and President-for-life Xi ambitions to be a global power and, over time, replace the U.S. as the preeminent global power.""
 
 Some Israeli startups now have begun shying away from attractive Chinese investment offers, afraid that the U.S. could retaliate by barring them from operating in America down the line if they have any Chinese involvement.
 
 Tensions surround reported U.S. demands that Israel restrict Chinese investments in Israeli infrastructure and technology. President Trump warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in March that U.S.-Israeli defense and intelligence cooperation could be harmed if Israel does not act, the news website Axios reported.
 
 ""If certain systems go in certain places then America's efforts to work alongside you will be more difficult, and in some places we won't be able to do so,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Israeli television. ""Intelligence sharing might have to be reduced, co-location of security facilities might have to be reduced, we want to make that sure countries understand this and know the risks.""
 
 Israeli national security officials are working to form an oversight body, modeled after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, to screen deals for risks. ""A committee on foreign investment in Israel should be viewed as an essential means to protect Israel's critical national assets from outside influence and possible damage, and nothing else,"" Jacob Nagel, Israel's former national security adviser, wrote in March.
 
 The U.S. has tightened restrictions on Chinese investments in sensitive U.S. technologies, like quantum computing and artificial intelligence, and it has been urging allies to do the same. U.S. officials accuse Israel of dragging its feet, according to Axios.
 
 ""In our view, foreign investment in Israel — like foreign investment in the United States — should take place within the confines of strong regulatory structures that ensure all companies investing in Israel do so in a responsible manner, consistent with international practices,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus told NPR. ""Foreign investment should benefit the people of Israel, not undermine Israeli national security.""
 
 In recent years, Israel and China have held talks for a bilateral free-trade agreement. Following a round of negotiations in January in Jerusalem, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said, ""Israel is an important partner in the Middle East and along the Belt and Road,"" referring to China's plan to invest in land and sea trade routes across several continents.
 
 China is Israel's largest trading partner in Asia and its third-largest worldwide, after the European Union and the U.S., according to the governmental Israeli Export Institute. Chinese investments and construction in Israel reached $12.19 billion between 2005 and 2019, according to the American Enterprise Institute. Last year, exports of electronic components from Israel to China increased by 80%, the Israeli Export Institute says.
 
 ""Israel and the U.S. have different threat perceptions with China,"" said Assaf Orion, a retired Israeli army general who directs the China program at the Institute for National Security Studies, an independent Israeli research institute. ""Israel is way tuned against its traditional enemies, and China is not one of our enemies.""
 
 China drops anchor at Haifa port
 
 U.S. officials have warned countries to be wary of accepting Chinese help in their infrastructure, warning it could give China more power and stronger capabilities to spy. What makes the U.S. particularly concerned about China's reach in Israel is that Israel holds some of the world's most advanced technologies and shares a sensitive intelligence and defense relationship with the U.S.
 
 One sore point is an empty platform jutting out into the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Haifa — the site of a future shipping container terminal that Israel has invited a Chinese company, Shanghai International Port Group, to build and operate for 25 years. Israel expects this terminal to expand its shipping capacity, vital for the Israeli economy.
 
 Next to the port is Israel's main naval base, home to Israel's submarine fleet. The U.S. is concerned because that's where the U.S. Navy's 6th Fleet conducts exercises and where it would be stationed to help Israel in the event of war. U.S. officials fear China could use the terminal to collect intelligence on U.S. military activities.
 
 A U.S. spending bill put forth this summer said the Senate ""has an interest in the future forward presence of United States naval vessels at the Port of Haifa in Israel but has serious security concerns with respect to the leasing arrangements of the Port of Haifa."" It calls to urge Israel to ""consider the security implications of foreign investment in Israel.""
 
 Shaul Chorev, a former deputy chief of the Israeli navy, thinks it was a mistake to give control of such strategic infrastructure to a foreign company, which could shut down the port during wartime, hurting Israel's economy. ""First, they can spy. Second, they can limit the activity of the harbor in case of emergency,"" Chorev said, on a mountaintop in Haifa overlooking the port.
 
 The port is not the only Chinese investment in the country. A Chinese state-owned company now owns a stake in an Israeli electric power plant, while another Chinese company is building a commuter light rail line in Tel Aviv, among other examples.
 
 U.S. officials are concerned these projects give China an entry for intelligence gathering, and believe China is using the projects as a stepping stone to increased access to Western European markets, by proving its ability to meet Israel's high-infrastructure standards.
 
 ""While we are not asking Israel to avoid dealing with China entirely, we have open discussions with all our closest allies and partners on the national security implications of Chinese investment,"" Michael Mulroy, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, told The Atlantic. ""The Department of Defense is concerned about China's desire to erode U.S. military advantages, as well as China's push for access and basing, use of economics to intimidate through the One Belt One Road initiative ... and technology and intellectual property theft, acquisition and penetration.""
 
 Eyeing Israeli technology
 
 Chinese investments in Israeli tech startups shot up a few years ago in fields like cybersecurity, digital health and automated car technology.
 
 ""We were getting requests probably a couple of times a month of new investment deals, most of which went through,"" said Simon Weintraub, a Tel Aviv lawyer who represents Israeli tech firms in negotiations with Chinese investors. His office in an iconic Tel Aviv skyscraper is decorated with gifts from Chinese business colleagues, like a cute panda picture hanging on the wall.
 
 Amid a rift with the U.S. over Israeli sales of military technology to China, Israel adopted defense export restrictions in 2006. U.S. officials think Chinese access to cutting-edge technologies in Israel's private sector can be adapted by China's military, helping it compete directly with the U.S.
 
 ""The Chinese have shown interest in Israeli technology,"" Rood said at the Israeli security conference. ""In some areas where China has made investments or pursued activities around the world, the security services have followed or been a part of those dealings.""
 
 Last month, China's Ambassador to Israel Zhan Yongxin wrote in Israel's Haaretz newspaper that China has ""no ulterior motives"" and criticized what he called ""groundless accusations"" that China intends to exploit its investments in Israel for intelligence and security threats.
 
 Israel is not currently restricting its companies from accepting Chinese investments, and big investment deals continue. But some Israeli businesses are deciding on their own to refuse Chinese money, Weintraub said.
 
 ""I get calls all the time from Israeli companies who have either taken money previously from China or considering to take new investments from China,"" Weintraub said. ""They're very nervous about taking money from China and somehow being under scrutiny in the United States.""
 
 One Israeli health care technology company he represents recently turned down a multimillion dollar offer from a major Chinese venture capitalist, he said. The company, which works on sensitive medical records, is worried about being cut off from business with U.S. hospitals if it has Chinese investors.
 
 This does not mean Israeli companies are abandoning China.
 
 He said the company and others like it would get creative, seeking to set up a new corporate structure, such as a separate isolated entity in China that is firewalled from the rest of the company's activities, to work with the country anyway, while avoiding red flags in the U.S.
 
 ""I know that China isn't going anywhere. China is a superpower and a rising superpower,"" Weintraub said.

 In Southeast Asia's only landlocked country, the Mekong River is a lifeline. From a slow boat heading up the river in Laos, you'll see fishermen working in their boats, riverside farms where bananas grow, and domesticated buffalo lazing. Occasionally a ferry chugs by. From time to time, steps leading to a riverside village become visible on the banks through the foliage. The wind is swift, and the brown fresh water laps up onto the side of the boat.
 
 Just over 9 miles north of Luang Prabang, a startling aberration appears: five giant concrete pylons rising out of the water.
 
 Red cranes top each of the pylons. A bridge is being built here. On either bank, the row of pylons continues until it almost hits the mountainsides, with scaffolding and other heavy construction equipment scattered below.
 
 When it's finished, the bridge will be part of a new China-Laos railway. Its planned 250-plus miles of track are meant to connect China's southern Yunnan province with Laos' capital, Vientiane.
 
 Laotian officials have promised the high-speed railway, slated to open in 2021, will be good for the country.
 
 ""Once completed, the railway will benefit Lao people of all ethnic groups, facilitate and reduce costs of transportation, stimulate the development of agricultural and industrial sectors, tourism, investment and trade, as well as generate income for Lao people and the country,"" Lao Minister of Public Works and Transport Bouchanh Sinthavong said during the groundbreaking ceremony outside Luang Prabang in 2016.

 But for many Laotian people, the benefits aren't yet clear.
 
 The risk of debt distress
 
 The railway is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative — a $1.3 trillion project that looks to establish a vast network of investment and infrastructure spanning Asia, Europe and Africa.
 
 Brian Eyler, Southeast Asia program director at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C., describes the plan as a ""grand vision"" that involves China building bridges, railways, ports, highways and airports all over the world.
 
 ""Not necessarily to link China to the rest of the world,"" he explains. ""But to create channels to bring natural resources and commercial inputs back to China so that China's economy can keep growing.""
 
 As a direct neighbor to China with ample access to the critical Mekong River, Laos is seen as a ""linking country,"" Eyler says. The China-Laos railway is part of a line that will eventually extend from Kunming, the Yunnan provincial capital, through Malaysia and all the way south to Singapore.
 
 It's an expensive project for one of Southeast Asia's poorest countries. According to the World Bank, while Laos' economy has grown consistently over the past decade, the country's GDP was still only about $16 billion in 2017. The International Monetary Fund ranked Laos 36th out of 42 Asian countries in 2018.
 
 Of the almost $6 billion cost for the China-Laos railway, the Chinese government will pay 70 percent. Laos will finance the remaining 30 percent with loans from Chinese financial institutions.
 
 Eyler says China is a new power player in Laos, whose government most likely found this influx of cash for much needed infrastructure projects attractive. But many wonder if the Laotian government has the ability to pay back such large loans.
 
 ""And it's not just the railway's debt that's of concern, but it's the accumulating mass of debt related to Chinese projects in Laos that have put the country very much on alert for ... overleveraged debt,"" Eyler says.
 
 Concerns about debt are not unique to Laos. Many experts have expressed misgivings over how China is financing large infrastructure projects in developing nations. A 2018 report by the Center for Global Development identified eight countries, including Laos, among 68 potential Belt and Road Initiative borrowers as being ""at particular risk of debt distress.""
 
 A Vientiane resident is not convinced. She does not want NPR to use her name for fear that giving an interview to a journalist will result in retribution from the Laotian government.
 
 Enlarge this image toggle caption Ashley Westerman/NPR Ashley Westerman/NPR
 
 Her concern about the railway: ""Because we borrow money from the Chinese government to build this railway and how much the Lao people have to owe, and pay back. The debt,"" she says. ""So I'm not quite sure about the benefits.""
 
 Feeling left out
 
 As Laos is a tightly controlled communist state, there likely isn't much dialogue between the Laotian government and the public, Eyler notes. The benefits of the railway to the Laotian people haven't been well-articulated, he says.
 
 Just seeing the way in which the railway is being constructed has given residents pause. Despite the Chinese government's claiming that the project would create thousands of jobs for local people, many Laotians say they don't know anyone who has been employed.
 
 ""All the construction work was handed off to China Railway Group, and Chinese engineers and laborers have descended on [Laos] in droves. ... Not even the Laotian government is clear on the exact number of Chinese workers in the country,"" the Nikkei Asian Review reported in 2017.
 
 Enlarge this image toggle caption Ashley Westerman/NPR Ashley Westerman/NPR
 
 Chinese state-run media have published various articles claiming the railway is changing local lives for the better. But on the ground, residents have told journalists that thousands were ordered off their land to make way for the railway and aren't being compensated as promised.
 
 Some people living along the path of the new railway see its completion as tantamount to a Chinese invasion.
 
 In Luang Prabang, a man who did not want to use his name for fear of government retribution says he understands why people would like a new train. It's faster, cheaper and makes traveling easier.
 
 ""But I worry that when the trains are completed, there will be many, many Chinese [moving] in from China to live in Laos and they will take the job[s] from local people,"" he says.
 
 He says even the promise of more tourists coming into Luang Prabang isn't necessarily appealing. According to the local tourism office, the number of visitors to Luang Prabang in 2000 was just under 102,000. In 2018, more than 755,000 tourists came to the city — an increase of more than 600 percent. And in recent years, the tourists have overwhelmingly been Chinese. But Chinese tourists rely on Chinese-run tour groups, stay in Chinese-owned hotels and eat at Chinese-owned restaurants, the man says.
 
 ""All the money go back to China, not for Laos people,"" he says.
 
 Some say they wish the money for the railway could be used to fix their country's crumbling roads and schools. Others are deeply concerned about the potential impact of the new railway on Laos' ecosystem as it cuts through the country's dwindling forests, tunnels through its mountains and disrupts the landscape of the Mekong River.
 
 Conservationists working to rehabilitate Laos' critically low elephant population — just 400 in the wild — are worried that these animals won't survive more habitat fragmentation and disruption from such large infrastructure projects.
 
 Both the Luong Prabang resident and the Vientiane resident say many others in their communities share their misgivings about the railway.

 Imran Khan was sworn in Saturday as Pakistan's new Prime Minister, ushering in a new era in the country. The legendary cricket star and international playboy turned politician was voted in with a slim majority – just 51 percent of the vote — and allegations of election meddling and voter irregularities.
 
 In an emotional speech after the vote, Khan repeated a campaign theme of vowing to stamp out corruption. On Saturday Khan approved his cabinet, and appointed one of his top aides, Shireen Mazari, to minister designate of human rights.
 
 She dismissed charges of fraud in the election results, telling NPR, ""We have said that in whichever constituency that the opposition feels the results were tampered with they should go to the courts. We will not stop them....If we were being backed by the powerful, then why would our candidates win by 70 votes or 80 votes. Our candidates would have swept the election with huge margins of victory.""
 
 Mazari told NPR that Khan will deliver on his agenda, which she said ""has consistently been one of justice, and of giving a level playing field to all citizens, especially the poorest of the poor. Giving them their basic human rights, and basically establishing Pakistan as a welfare state.""
 
 Khan ran on a populist platform, and promised to establish an Islamic welfare state to take care of the poor. However he has inherited many other challenges, the most pressing of which is the country's faltering economy.
 
 According to The New York Times, ""Pakistan's current account deficit stands at $18 billion, while its foreign-currency reserves are just $10.1 billion, enough to cover two months of imports.""
 
 Pakistan will likely have to rely on both the U.S. and China to help shore up its economy. The New York Times reports, ""Just days after the election, China gave Pakistan a $2 billion loan to help shore up its finances, following $1 billion given by Chinese banks in April. And more money is needed, soon.""
 
 Over the next few weeks Pakistan is expected to begin negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, and ask for loans worth up to $12 billion, according to The New York Times.
 
 Munir Akram is Pakistan's former ambassador to the United Nations, and tells NPR the US will have a big impact on these talks. ""The US control of dollar transactions, the IMF, the banking system, that influence is going to remain. It has an inordinate impact on the global economy and on Pakistan's current situation, where its economy is faltering, where we have a balance of payments problem, where we may need to go back to the IMF,"" Munir continues, ""I think the US influence will be exercised there. Whether it will be exercised positively or negatively remains to be seen.""
 
 Ties between the US and Pakistan have weakened in recent years, with the Trump administration cutting aid to Pakistan, citing the country as a safe haven for terrorists, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned that IMF money should not be used to pay off Chinese lenders to Pakistan.
 
 Mazari says Khan's election will provide an opportunity for the US and Pakistan to reset relations. ""So many of our leaders have had their own personal survival, and own personal interests, taking priority over national interests,"" Mazari told NPR, ""Especially the military dictators we have had, for their survival in power, they allied with the U.S. at whatever cost, without any give or take, without any negotiation.""
 
 Khan she says, will demand reciprocity. ""If the U.S. would like us to help and assist it, whether its war in Afghanistan, trying to bring peace there, or any other policy issue, then we also expect the U.S. to aid and assist us in our national priorities. We cannot have a state saying if you don't do xyz, we will suspend abc. That's not the way it works. There has to be respect and mutuality of interests,"" Mazari says. ""If we do not have interests in common, if we do not respect each other, if we are not prepared to be reciprocal in our exchanges, then it will be very difficult to sustain the relationship, and that is one reason we have had ups and downs in our relationship with the U.S.""
 
 Mazari describes the U.S. as a destabilizing force in the region, through its support of India, and says the U.S. and Pakistan are not strategic allies, because they don't share strategic interests. She told NPR the U.S. doesn't ""understand Pakistan.""
 
 ""I think there is general discomfort with a strong Muslim state, especially one that has nuclear weapons,"" Mazari said.
 
 China, however, is a stabilizing force and proven ally and partner according to Mazari. ""You will not find Pakistan being concerned by the ongoing trade relationship between India and China, because we don't see that as a threat. We see China as a stabilizer in the region,"" Mazari said, ""But the U.S. India relationship for us is a great concern, because it has a major military and nuclear dimension which directly impacts our nuclear deterrence. So this is the contrast between how the U.S. acts in South Asia, and how China acts in South Asia.""
 
 ""Over the years we have seen China stand by Pakistan, in difficult times, not just bilaterally but also in international forums,"" Mazari told NPR. ""So China has proven to be an ally and a partner, in times of difficulty, in times when we find ourselves without many friends externally.""
 
 China's economic ties have grown rapidly in recent years through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. CPEC's 15-year investment program includes projects to address energy shortages, build infrastructure and a deep water port in Pakistan. According to Foreign Policy, Chinese firms have finalized $19 billion in investments in Pakistan since CPEC launched in 2013.
 
 Critics of China's Belt and Road Initiative say loans tied to these projects have lured Pakistan into a ""Chinese debt trap."" Akram says that's not the case, and that the interest rate on loans from China is low, ""The average interest rate is 3 percent. The payback to China of those loans will not come online for at least 10 years. Past loans to China which we are going to service over the next five years, amount to around 600 million dollars, which is less than one-tenth of the amount that has to be paid back to western sources of debt that we have accumulated. So the Chinese burden that people talk about, the debt burden, is not there.""
 
 According to Foreign Policy, debts to China still present a long-term risk for Pakistan:
 
 ""Although China has not caused Pakistan's current economic turmoil, it seems likely that CPEC could spur the next crisis unless conditions change. According to a 2017 IMF assessment, debt service obligations to the Chinese state, banks, and firms are projected to grow gradually, peaking in 2025 at between about $3.4 billion and $4.5 billion. These estimates likely undervalue the full repayment obligations Pakistan will have under CPEC, as they do not seem to include tariffs for power generated by Chinese firms, toll fees for Chinese built roads, or maintenance and operation expenses.""
 
 Akram says he expects the relationship between China and Pakistan to continue grow, ""The Chinese have indicated that they are quite accommodating of Pakistan's priorities...I will expect that the relationship will expand, will become more intense, and Chinese support for Pakistan's economy is more or less a given, as far as I see it.""","['khan', 'state', 'sworn', 'minister', 'mazari', 'pakistans', 'chinese', 'imran', 'relationship', 'office', 'prime', 'pakistan', 'china', 'billion', 'npr', 'times']","{'Afghanistan': 1, 'China': 17, 'India': 3, 'Pakistan': 27, 'United States': 5}",,,,,

 Major issues such as trade, security and China's expansion are up for discussion when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travels to Southeast Asia this week. On the first leg of his trip, in Malaysia, he'll be checking in on a new government for the first time.
 
 Pompeo's meetings with senior Malaysian officials, planned for Thursday and Friday, follow a shock election in May that brought back to power the country's aging authoritarian leader, Mahathir Mohamad.
 
 Now 93, Mahathir was prime minister for 22 years until 2003. This year, he staged a stunning political comeback to unseat his former protégé, Najib Razak, who governed for a decade.
 
 The U.S. secretary of state arrives at a time of great change for Malaysia. In recent months, Malaysia not only chose a new leader — it also arrested the previous one, Najib, and charged him with corruption. Meanwhile, China has continued its strategic expansion across the region.
 
 The U.S. and Malaysia did over $50 billion in bilateral trade alone in 2017, according to the U.S. State Department, making Malaysia one of America's leading trading partners of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as ASEAN. Pompeo is also due to attend an ASEAN forum in Singapore this weekend.

 ""Taking advantage to meet the new government in Malaysia is a sign of the [U.S.] commitment to building ties with allies and partners alike,"" says Satu Limaye, head of the research nonprofit East-West Center's Washington office.
 
 Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib had good relations with the United States and even paid a visit to the White House last year. The new leader Mahathir, who often railed against the U.S. during his earlier term in office, is now expected to carry on his country's good U.S. ties, according to Limaye.
 
 If anything is changing, it may be Malaysia's assessment of plans with China.
 
 ""The biggest change I see so far ... is the re-evaluation of some Belt and Road initiative infrastructure projects that Malaysia was looking at with China,"" Limaye says. Belt and Road is China's more than $1 trillion global development initiative. Malaysia's new government has suspended a major rail project under the initiative.
 
 Still, it's early days, says Limaye, so it's difficult to say what direction Malaysia is headed. And the country has been quite unpredictable lately.
 
 A shock to the system
 
 No one could have predicted what would happen in Malaysia in the May 9 election that resulted in its longtime ruling party being defeated for the first time.
 
 The National Front coalition, and all of its past iterations, had been in power since Malaysia's independence from British rule in 1957. Even if its dominance in parliament had eroded slightly since its peak in 2004, the National Front was expected to retain power. For years, it had doled out patronage and worked to undermine the opposition.
 
 Then, earlier this year, its onetime leader, Mahathir, left his old coalition and created a new one. He aligned with opposition politicians to form Pakatan Harapan, or the Alliance of Hope.
 
 Mahathir also broke with the country's long tradition of race-based parties and urged voters to ""forget the racial origins and think of themselves as pure Malaysians.""
 
 The National Front is made up of several race-based groups, including the United Malays National Organization, Malaysian Indian Congress and the Malaysian Chinese Association.
 
 Mahathir's efforts to reach across racial lines helped loosen party affiliation, even among rural Malays — a stronghold for the National Front — and especially among young voters, according to Tan Seng Keat with the Merdeka Center for Opinion Research.
 
 During his campaign, Mahathir also zeroed in on the multibillion-dollar corruption scandal involving a government investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), that dogged the incumbent Najib for years. In July, Najib was arrested for allegedly skimming from the fund for personal use.
 
 Further, the ruling party's message of ""Make My Country Great With National Front"" struggled to connect with voters. According to surveys before the election, voters were most concerned about the corruption and economic issues that persisted under the only ruling party they had ever known.
 
 On election day, Mahathir's new alliance raked in more than 48 percent of the vote and swept 121 of the 222 seats in parliament. Najib's National Front came away with just 33 percent and 79 seats.
 
 A new Malaysia?
 
 Today, Malaysians are still euphoric over the results and Mahathir's return. Even members of smaller parties outside the two main coalitions tell NPR they feel like they finally have an opportunity to participate in the democratic system.
 
 Yet analysts caution that it may still be too early to tell whether this is truly a ""New Malaysia"" — a moniker commentators are using for the country since the election.
 
 Critics of Mahathir are skeptical the onetime strongman's new term as prime minister will be any different from his previous one. Dubbed ""The Father of Modern Malaysia,"" Mahathir is credited with bringing political stability and economic growth to the country. But he also was known to silence dissidents, attack the judiciary and control the press.
 
 He even jailed his former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, for challenging his governance during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s on charges that were widely criticized. In mid-May, Anwar was granted a full pardon and — in another possible twist — is even expected to take over as prime minister within the next two years. Analysts say this is an indicator that Mahathir has changed.
 
 The new Mahathir is older and wiser than when he first led the country, says Tan Sri Rastam Mohd Isa, chairman of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies Malaysia, a think tank in Kuala Lumpur.
 
 ""He's [now] leading a coalition that comprises different parties, different ambitions and, in a way, different ideologies,"" he says.
 
 How the 1MDB scandal is handled will be a major opportunity for Mahathir to show his government can usher in real change.
 
 Former Prime Minister Najib was charged with corruption and three counts of criminal breach of trust for his alleged connection with the scandal. The U.S. Justice Department is also investigating whether Najib laundered some of that money through U.S. financial institutions.
 
 ""No prime minister [in Malaysia] has ever been charged for such offenses,"" says Simrit Kaur, a Malaysian journalist. They asked NPR not to disclose their employer as they are speaking in a personal capacity and not on behalf of their news outlet.
 
 Najib has pleaded not guilty and has maintained his innocence ever since the scandal was brought to international attention in 2015 by The Wall Street Journal.
 
 The credibility of the new government and Malaysian institutions would be at stake if Najib is found not guilty, Kaur tells NPR in an email.

91,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/15/eu-china-summit-bejing-xi-jinping-belt-and-road,0,,UK,W,2017-05-15 00:00:00,EU backs away from trade statement in blow to China's 'modern Silk Road' plan,"The EU has dealt a blow to Chinese president Xi Jinping’s bid to lead a global infrastructure revolution, after its members refused to endorse part of the multibillion-dollar plan because it did not include commitments to social and environmental sustainability and transparency.
 
 Xi made his latest bid for global leadership on Monday, telling leaders including Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that the world should reject protectionism, embrace globalisation and pull together like a skein of geese.
 
 Xi’s comments came on the second and final day of a high-profile summit in Beijing about his Belt and Road initiative, a multibillion-dollar infrastructure spree that China claims will kickstart a new era of trade and development. The scheme’s ultimate aim – encompassing pipelines and a port in Pakistan, bridges in Bangladesh and railways to Russia – is to create what China calls a “modern Silk Road”.
 
 The $900bn question: What is the Belt and Road initiative? Read more
 
 However, in a snub to Xi’s rallying cry for cooperation, the Guardian understands that the EU’s 28 member states decided not to support a statement about trade prepared by Beijing to mark the end of the summit.
 
 “We made clear that, for Europe, the Belt and Road initiative can only be a success if it’s based on transparency and co-ownership,” said one high-level EU diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Apparently to Chinese surprise, the EU was united on this.”
 
 The rejected statement related to a trade panel held during the Beijing summit that was attended by representatives of countries including Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Spain. China had hoped that all EU member states, as well as other nations attending the conference, would support the text, one of three prepared to mark the end of the convention on Monday.
 
 Beijing had billed the forum as its most important diplomatic event of the year and hoped it would give global legitimacy to Xi’s signature foreign policy initiative. Leaders from Africa, Asia and Latin America flew in to Beijing to show their support.
 
 However, the leaders of most major western powers, including Donald Trump, Angela Merkel and Theresa May, skipped the event while India voiced public opposition to what one newspaper called “a colonial enterprise”.
 
 
 
 The Guardian understands that EU members decided not to support China’s trade statement because a series of concerns they had raised with the Chinese government were not incorporated into the draft text.
 
 A public summary of the EU’s position on the Belt and Road initiative, published in the runup to the forum, suggested members wanted guarantees that projects would be economically and environmentally sustainable and subject to fair tendering processes.
 
 An unnamed diplomat confirmed to Agence France-Press that several EU states had declined to back China’s trade statement.
 
 A spokesperson for the British government said that since the UK had not taken part in the trade panel related to the statement it would not have been expected to sign up to outcomes related to that session.
 
 “The UK welcomes the Belt and Road initiative, which has the potential to promote and develop economic growth,” the spokesperson said, adding that the chancellor, Philip Hammond, had taken part in a session about finance and that the UK had signed up to principles related to that event.
 
 On Sunday morning, Hammond offered a resounding endorsement of Xi’s “bold and visionary project” telling his hosts Britain was “a natural partner” in the scheme.
 
 Speaking at Beijing’s Mao-era Great Hall of the People on Sunday night, Xi said his “project of the century” would “add splendour to human civilisation” and help build a new era of harmony and trade. On Monday he said his plan was “open to all like-minded friends … It does not exclude or target any party”.
 
 However, some sceptics see the plan as largely a ruse to boost China’s own economy by shifting excess industrial capacity to less developed nations and draw poorer countries tighter into Beijing’s economic grip.
 
 Chinese state media hit back at critics on Monday. “Some countries seem obsessed with the idea of containment or game-playing, and seem unable to see the truth in the mist of history,” an editorial in the Beijing Youth Daily said.
 
 Speaking to the state-controlled China Daily, one Chinese academic rejected the suggestion that Beijing was guilty of “practising neo-colonialism ... exploiting energy resources ... [and] supporting authoritarian regimes”. He Jingtong, a business professor at Nankai University in Tianjin, said: “I think none of this holds water.

More significantly, Xi expanded Beijing’s foothold in the strategic port of Piraeus, from whence a rising tide of Chinese imports flow into the EU.
 
 By co-opting an EU and Nato member into his all-encompassing Belt and Road initiative and effectively hiring it as a bespoke “gateway to Europe”, Xi advanced China’s overall global ambitions. The demarche also highlights a bigger, possibly existential, challenge for the EU: how to avoid becoming the meat in the sandwich between a ravenous China and an increasingly unreliable, surly and hostile United States.
 
 A key platform in Beijing’s strategy is the so-called “17+1” group that comprises China, 16 CEE (central and east European) countries and now Greece. Leading EU powers such as Germany and France are suspicious, fearing the 17+1 is an attempt to divide Europe. The EU commission declared China a “systemic rival” in March after Xi embarked on another horse-trading expedition to Italy.
 
 Recent speeches in Athens and Berlin by Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, have stressed the strategic and geopolitical dimension. He warned Europe was being sucked into a nefarious Chinese web already spanning Asia, Africa and Latin America. China was “using economic means to coerce countries into lopsided deals that benefit Beijing and leave its clients mired in debt,” Pompeo claimed.
 
 China is trying to mitigate such fears. It has pledged to respect EU rules and agreed to a 17+1 statement referencing the “three pillars of the United Nations” – peace and security, human rights and development. That was an obvious sop to western concerns about human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

 Yet however it is presented, the advance of Chinese business, financial and political influence across Europe appears irresistible. China is already the EU’s largest trading partner. Chinese mega-companies such as Huawei are on the march, defying US opposition. Austerity-hit countries crave investment, from any source. Last week saw another symbolic power play, with Jingye’s purchase of British Steel.
 
 EU leaders such as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Germany’s defence minister and presumed heir to Angela Merkel, are well aware of Xi’s advance from the east. AKK, as she is known, recently suggested Germany should support “our partners in the Indo-Pacific region” who feel threatened by China’s new military assertiveness. For risk-averse Berlin, that’s a big deal.
 
 Right now, with a Nato summit due in London early next month, AKK and others are looking the other way – at the vexed question of the Trump administration’s waning commitment to transatlantic cooperation in general, and Nato in particular. Macron produced his own Trojan horse last week, suggesting the alliance might be superseded by what he fondly calls a “European defence union”.
 
 Macron’s ideas about increased European financial, economic, security and political integration seem to have few takers. But his argument – that without it, Europe will be unable to hold its own against the US, China and Russia – has a certain logic. Macron accepts Donald Trump’s demand that Nato’s European members should spend more on defence. But he would prefer they did so separately from the US-led alliance, under EU, principally French, auspices.
 
 Ulrike Esther Franke, an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, suggests Macron may find a more sympathetic audience in Kramp-Karrenbauer, should she become chancellor. Both agree American international engagement is dwindling under Trump. “They both worry about the rise of China, the return of great power competition, and the risk Europe will be marginalised,” Franke wrote.]
 
 The potential threat to Europe posed by the US, especially but not only if Trump is re-elected, extends beyond reduced military collaboration and unilateral US decision-making, such as its green light for Turkey’s invasion of Syria. Trump continues to denigrate the EU, pursue aggressive anti-European trade policies, appease Vladimir Putin’s Russia and push Britain towards a hard Brexit.
 
 Boris Johnson’s blocking of publication of a British parliamentary investigation into Russian election and referendum meddling was condemned last week as “shaming” by Trump’s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton. Was Johnson’s unexplained decision an example of the influence exerted by Trump, who has repeatedly obstructed similar US investigations?
 
 Suddenly, the plot of John Le Carre’s new thriller, Agent Running in the Field, in which American and British spies secretly conspire to subvert the EU, does not seem all that improbable. Increased British collusion and subordination to the US, partly resulting from London’s desperate need for a post-Brexit trade deal on almost any terms, will intensify challenges on the EU’s western flank.
 
 Sandwiched between the perfidious “Anglos” on one side and the calculating Chinese on the other, and with Russians constantly on the lookout for ways to weaken the western democracies, the EU’s newly elected, untested leaders may struggle to keep the union safe, intact and prosperous.
 
 Perhaps these big beasts smell blood? With the once-dominant, steadying figure of Merkel on her way out, with EU policy on Iran, Syria, Libya, Palestine, Ukraine and migration in tatters, with money short and with far-right nationalists and populists stalking a politically fragmented continent from Spain to Poland, the European project – like a modern-day Troy – is looking uniquely vulnerable.","['surly', 'european', 'europe', 'hungry', 'eu', 'chinese', 'macron', 'chinas', 'squeezed', 'tisdall', 'china', 'week', 'xi', 'simon', 'trump']","{'China': 13, 'Germany': 3, 'Spain': 1, 'France': 1, 'Greece': 3, 'Hong Kong': 1, 'Italy': 1, 'Libya': 1, 'Poland': 1, 'Turkey': 1, 'Ukraine': 1, 'United States': 9}",,,,,

 Scott Morrison has rebuked the Victorian government for signing up to China’s Belt and Road initiative, saying he was “surprised” it had not been more “cooperative” by consulting the commonwealth first.
 
 Morrison’s remarks, made on the campaign trail in Queensland,put him at odds with the foreign minister, Marise Payne, who downplayed the significance of the secret memorandum of understanding earlier on Tuesday.
 
 On 25 October the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, finalised the MOU with the Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, making Victoria the first and only Australian state to support President Xi Jinping’s global trade and infrastructure initiative.
 
 In response to questions from the Nine Network on 2 November, the Victorian government said that it “consulted with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade during the MOU’s drafting process and Dfat have been provided with a copy”.

 While Dfat responded that it “became aware in June that Victoria was considering” joining the Belt and Road initiative, as it is also known, it said the government was not informed the MOU had been signed until 25 October, when it was announced.
 
 On Tuesday Morrison told reporters on the Sunshine Coast that he was “surprised that the Victorian government went into that arrangement without any discussions with the commonwealth government at all or taking … any advice … on what is a matter of international relations”.
 
 “They’re the responsibilities of the commonwealth government and I would’ve hoped the Victorian government would’ve taken a more cooperative approach to that process.
 
 “They know full well our policy on those issues and I thought that was not a very cooperative or helpful way to do things on such issues.”
 
 Earlier on Tuesday, Payne told ABC’s AM she had not seen the MOU before it was signed and the commonwealth was not advised, explaining it was a “matter for Victoria”.
 
 “We encourage the states and territories to expand opportunities with China” but those practices should reflect the need for “stability, security, prosperity and the usual transparency requirements”, she said.
 
 Payne said it was “not in the least [bit]” embarrassing the commonwealth was not consulted, explaining “the states and territories … make arrangements of this nature, at this level, regularly, with other countries in this region and more broadly.”
 
 “Any treaty level arrangements, of course, are made at the commonwealth level.”
 
 Asked if it was normal practice to keep the MOU secret, Payne refrained from criticism of the Victorian government, explaining it “depends on arrangements between the parties” and it was a matter for the states and territories to decide.
 
 The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, had also reportedly welcomed Victoria’s deal with China despite not having seen the details of the MOU.
 
 “I haven’t discussed the content of it with Victoria but we have been, and are, positive for Australian engagement in BRI, where those projects are sustainable projects that provide clear benefits for the recipients,” he reportedly told the Australian.
 
 “If Victoria has seen opportunities to do so consistent with those terms, that’s something we welcome.”
 
 Payne also said the Australian government had noted reports of construction of internment camps for the Uighur minority and had “serious concerns” about the human rights situation in China’s Xinjiang province.
 
 She said there would be “statements made in the [United Nations] human rights council this week” and she would pursue the matter in discussions “in the appropriate way”.","['initiative', 'victoria', 'mou', 'matter', 'belt', 'trade', 'seen', 'rebukes', 'chinas', 'commonwealth', 'scott', 'states', 'told', 'territories', 'victorian', 'morrison', 'signing', 'road']","{'Australia': 5, 'China': 4}",,,,,

 China's pursuit of business and economic links to the Middle East is expected to spur further development in Islamic finance around the world. Specifically, China's Belt and Road Initiative, a regional infrastructure investment program spanning over 100 countries, has been touted as a boon for the Islamic banking sector. Such financing complies with Sharia principles, meaning it adheres to the Islamic laws that prohibit earning interest on loans and bar funding activities involving alcohol, pork, pornography or gambling. The linkage between the BRI and Sharia-compliant financing is that China will require vast investment to fund its grand ambitions to construct a network of land and maritime economic corridors through the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Much of that could come from funds raised through Islamic financing tools, experts said. On top of that, ""some of the projects (that are) part of the (BRI) will go through some core Islamic finance countries and therefore might be financed in Sharia-compliant ways,"" said Mohamed Damak, global head of Islamic finance at S&P Global Ratings. Many of the countries along the infrastructure belt are home to predominantly Muslim populations, including Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
 
 The Islamic finance market is poised to grow to $3.8 trillion by 2022 — up from $2.2 trillion in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters calculations. It also has potential beyond Muslim countries because organizations are placing greater importance on sustainability goals and such standards often have overlapping principles with Islamic investing. Beijing may be keen to get in on the action where the Belt and Road is concerned: State-owned news outlet CGTN published a May opinion piece cheering the possibility of Islamic financial vehicles pairing with the multi-content infrastructure project. ""Given the prudent decision of the Chinese leadership to significantly expand environmentally sustainable and climate-friendly infrastructure projects, there is a distinct opportunity to unlock the combined synergies through the convergence of Islamic finance and funding of the BRI,"" the author wrote.
 
 And some in the Middle East are already noting the potential. ""The Belt and Road is about supporting infrastructure development and economic growth,"" said Adnan Chilwan, chief executive of Dubai Islamic Bank, the UAE's biggest Sharia-compliant lender by assets, during an event in Dubai last October, as reported by UAE newspaper The National. ""When you talk about financing such projects, clearly there is a great opportunity for Islamic banking. It is a catalyst for bringing public and private funding together,"" Chilwan reportedly said. The BRI will be ""very important"" for Islamic financing and accelerate the halal trade, said Massimo Falcioni, CEO of Etihad Credit Insurance. The potential is huge as it covers everything from food to cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, tourism, and also insurance and financials, he said. ""I think pursuing (the BRI) is a big opportunity. It will create a corridor which is not existing"" and which covers 40% of GDP, said Falcioni. ""It's all an opportunity for everybody to participate."" Meanwhile, there have been some signals about Chinese interest in the space. The China-headquartered Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank signed a memorandum of understanding with the Islamic Development Bank — a Saudi Arabia-backed institution — to collaborate on various areas including Islamic finance development.
 
 Hurdles
 
 Despite the upbeat tone from industry watchers on the potential of Islamic financing, the issuance of its most well-known and accessible product — bonds known as sukuk — actually slowed in 2018, data show.
 
 The number of Islamic bonds or Sukuks issued slowed in 2018 after several years of growth. S&P Global
 
 That was mainly due to banks affected by the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira in 2018 and lower growth for some banks in the UAE and Qatar, said S&P's Damak. Sukuk issuance had grown strongly in 2017 in part from Chinese entities such as Country Garden and Beijing Enterprises Water Group issuing Islamic bonds through their Malaysian subsidiaries in 2015 and 2017, respectively. The companies used those proceeds to finance projects in the Southeast Asian country. But Chinese issuers have actually pulled away since then. That's been attributed to the complexities involved in rolling out such products, particularly as standards differ across regulatory regimes with varying interpretations of Sharia compliance. ""They say, 'The process is too complicated. We don't see the economic added value to walking this route,"" said Damak. ""In the past, there was some interest. There were a couple of issuers in China that have looked at the sukuk market eagerly ... but they eventually decided to walk away because of the complexities related to sukuk issuance,"" he said. ""They need to adjust to the regulatory environment, identify the underlying assets, structural goals, have lengthy discussions with lawyers and Sharia scholars to put together a transaction,"" Damak explained.","['sector', 'countries', 'projects', 'belt', 'financing', 'boost', 'sukuk', 'infrastructure', 'banking', 'beijings', 'bri', 'finance', 'plans', 'islamic', 'road']","{'United Arab Emirates': 1, 'China': 7, 'Kazakhstan': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Qatar': 1, 'Saudi Arabia': 1, 'Uzbekistan': 1}",,,,,

 Launched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is widely seen as China's effort to increase its global influence, primarily through the financing and construction of rail, sea and other transportation routes running from Asia to Europe and Africa.
 
 Critics say that through the massive infrastructure project, China forces developing nations to take on high debt burdens while benefiting Chinese companies which are often state-owned.
 
 Xi said Saturday that participants in the Belt and Road agreed to pursue high quality development.

 Speaking with CNBC on Thursday from Beijing, European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said his conversations with major companies indicated that China needed to be more transparent if it wants to win European corporate buy-in for its ""Belt and Road."" That initiative, a cornerstone of Chinese President Xi Jinping's foreign policy, seeks to create a massive web of shipping, rail, road, and digital networks that establishes Beijing as a linchpin for the world.
 
 China is reportedly seeking more outside involvement in its bid to invest in and support that infrastructure development, and Sefcovic is part of a lengthy list of global officials attending this week's Belt and Road Forum.
 
 European companies, he told CNBC, are first and foremost looking for information.
 
 ""They would love to be more involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, but we need a little bit more information coming for our companies: how they can participate, how they can bid in the public procurement — and of course also the sustainable financing of this project is important because it's raised some concerns also in Europe,"" he said.
 
 The worries about the financing approaches of the initiative come in the wake of several countries canceling or seeking to renegotiate their Belt and Road projects because of concerns about establishing onerous debt to Chinese sources. Notably, Sri Lanka relinquished a strategic port to Beijing in 2017 after it couldn't pay off its debt to Chinese companies.","['companies', 'initiative', 'buyin', 'european', 'beijing', 'eu', 'belt', 'chinese', 'president', 'china', 'sefcovic', 'seeking', 'transparent', 'official', 'road', 'needs']","{'China': 3, 'Sri Lanka': 1}",,,,,

""We are maximizing all precautionary measures, and I want to tell the U.S., and I will tell them as well in next week's visit, that they are our allies, and that we understand their concerns. But the contents of the MOU (memorandum of understanding) that we are signing tomorrow contains nothing for them to worry about, nothing relating to 5G or any agreement on strategic telecommunications,"" Di Maio told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Friday just before the signing. Italy on Saturday became the first Group of 7 country to join China's expansive Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), drawing concern from the U.S. and European allies. Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Rome saw a total of 29 deals signed, altogether worth 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion). They were focused on agricultural, finance and energy sectors, and opened up new access to the Chinese market for major Italian energy and engineering firms. Western critics warn of Chinese debt traps and describe the initiative as a ploy to expand geopolitical and strategic influence, while Beijing pursues links to Europe and Africa via South Asia and the Middle East to expedite and increase the export of Chinese goods. China and the U.S. are in the process of negotiations to end their protracted trade war, while Washington tries to combat what it sees as a security threat posed by Chinese telecommunications companies, particularly its largest, Huawei. The U.S. says Huawei's role in building 5G internet infrastructure around the world could allow the Chinese government to spy on users, a claim Beijing rejects.
 
 Di Maio, who also serves as minister of economic development and leader of the populist Five Star Movement, stressed that none of the deals discussed over the weekend involved 5G or telecommunications. ""On the doubts of the U.S. — who remain our allies, and with whom we remain aligned in the West, in NATO and in the EU — these doubts are more than understandable, and were part of the discussions we have had with the U.S. government, in relation to their 5G concerns,"" he said. ""5G is a strategic infrastructure that we are developing in our country. There are some concerns over the security of these telecommunications — and these are concerns that we share, and which we are addressing with new regulations on the 'golden power'. These are more restrictive and allow us to control the players that will enter the 5G telecommunications market in the coming years.""
 
 Protecting strategic industries
 
 Italy's 'golden power' legislation refers to government powers designed to protect strategic industries, which it says it plans to extend to 5G technologies. This would entail requiring Italian companies in both the private and public sectors to declare to the government any 5G technology purchased from non-European countries. Italy's economy fell into recession at the end of 2018, and the collapse of its Genoa Bridge last August drew attention to the dire state of its infrastructure. It has one of the highest levels of debt in the EU, and the audacious spending plans announced by its right-wing government after last year's elections were pared back after disputes with the rest of the EU. Still, the deputy prime minister dismissed notions that his government was aiming for greater Chinese purchases of Italian bonds, and focused on the benefits the deals would bring for Italian businesses. ""All the agreements that we are about to sign are based on the possibility of 'Made in Italy' to go to China, for our companies to export to China, after many years where 'Made in China' had been coming to Italy,"" he said. ""We are reversing the trend and rebalancing our trade flows — but there isn't any intent on making any pacts on financial support relating to goods, to the Treasury, or to government bonds."" ""We are not looking to ask China for help with our government bonds,"" he added. ""Instead, we are looking to advance our own agenda and create more jobs in Italy by increasing our exports to China.""","['washington', 'chinese', 'deals', 'initiative', 'reassure', 'maio', 'g7', 'italian', 'massive', 'minister', 'concerns', 'road', 'tries', 'italys', 'strategic', 'italy', 'telecommunications', 'china', '5g', 'join']","{'China': 7, 'Italy': 7}",,,,,

KCNA | Reuters
 
 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three-day meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing this week likely focused on a range of issues including economic ties, nuclear talks and the possibility of a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump. But there's one topic that likely wasn't officially discussed despite its importance to North Korea's future: The prospect of Pyongyang joining China's continent-spanning Belt and Road Initiative, a project aiming to link more than 60 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East through overland and maritime routes. The isolated state is hungry for foreign investments, particularly in infrastructure, as U.N. sanctions take a toll on its economy. Many believe that's been a major reason underlining Kim's engagement with the international community over the past year or so.
 
 Pyongyang's economic goal
 
 Now that the head of state has made major strides in nuclear technology, he can focus on his other major policy goal —economic development, politics watchers say.
 
 But to do so, Pyongyang needs help from its rich neighbors. The nuclear-armed nation is seeking more than $7.7 million in investment, the Seoul-based online newspaper NK News reported last month, citing information from a website run by North Korea's foreign trade ministry. Xi's Belt and Road project offers the perfect answer to those needs. China has historically been Pyongyang's largest trading partner. Pyongyang ""would love to be part of Belt and Road,"" Dane Chamorro, a senior partner in the Asia Pacific division of Control Risks, a consulting firm specializing in politics told CNBC on Friday. Kim's government is waiting for an invitation so his country can get assistance on the construction of railway links and ports and other facilities, Chamorro said. Beijing also seems keen on Pyongyang's inclusion, with the Chinese government inviting a North Korean delegation to attend a Belt and Road summit in 2017 — but it's unlikely to take any action for now. Including Pyongyang in the BRI is ""probably more trouble than it's worth"" at the present moment, said Mintaro Oba, a former U.S. State Department official who specialized in the Koreas during the administration of former President Barack Obama. For one, sanctions still remain in place. Beijing, however, has called for those penalties to be eased.

 ""It would also raise eyebrows in Washington and contribute to the perception that Belt and Road has low standards and primarily serves to deepen the dependence of other states on China,"" Oba said. Trump's White House is already skeptical of Beijing's activities overseas and has launched various initiatives to counter Chinese influence in Asia.

 China's massive Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure program has long been viewed as a platform to project Chinese power across the globe, despite official assertions to the contrary. New findings from the New York Times have now reinforced that argument, giving more weight to the idea that the investment plan may not purely be the economic project that Beijing insists. Last week, the Times said it had reviewed a confidential plan about China's military projects in Pakistan under the Belt and Road. According to the proposal, a special economic zone under the BRI's China-Pakistan Economic Corridor will be created to produce fighter jets while navigation systems and other military hardware will be jointly built at factories in Pakistan. That reveals how the world's second-largest economy ""is for the first time explicitly tying a Belt and Road proposal to its military ambitions,"" the Times said.
 
 In response, Lijian Zhao, deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Islamabad, took to Twitter to protest the newspaper's claims. He called the Times' report ""Western propaganda"" and emphasized that the bilateral economic corridor was purely economic in nature. For politics watchers, however, the Times' story strengthens deep-rooted suspicions of the BRI as a tool for the People's Liberation Army, China's armed forces.
 
 'No real surprise'
 
 ""This should come as no real surprise,"" said Michael Fuchs, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs from 2013 to 2016. The Times' report reinforces the notion that China's BRI project has military applications, he continued. That doesn't necessarily mean the Chinese military will use the entire BRI to its advantage, but it will certainly tap into a number of projects, he added. BRI infrastructure schemes in member countries such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Djibouti ""are all about giving access to China's military,"" he said.
 
 Beijing, last year, formally launched its first overseas military base in Djibouti. Sri Lanka's Hambantota port, which is under control of China Merchants Port Holdings, and a deep-sea port in Pakistan's Gwadar region are widely speculated to be potential bases for China's navy. ""Most people working in military circles knew there was a security dimension to [the BRI] so this [New York Times report] is just a confirmation at best,"" said James Chin, director of the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania. It's impossible, he added, for a country to separate military power and economic power when it is striving for greatness. Cynthia Watson, dean of faculty and academic programs at the National War College, echoed that sentiment, saying it was her opinion that the ""BRI is a means to alter China's relationship with this vast swath of nations."" ""It would be unlikely to completely exclude military [components] in the long run, regardless of policy statements in the past,"" she said.

 Gentiloni, who himself visited China in 2017 to discuss the Belt and Road initiative with Beijing's leadership, echoed the analyses of many observers who described the deals signed as largely symbolic and not an economic paradigm shift for Italy. ""The agreements signed in Italy are not so relevant from an economic point of view,"" he said. ""We will not change the mood of our economy with these agreements, and my guess is that perhaps we will not even change the balance of trade between Italy and China, which is unfortunately a balance of deficit on the Italian side."" But politically, he stressed, ""I am worried that we are not showing EU unity, and for this reason I think that the MOU (memorandum of understanding) that was signed from the Italian government was not a wise decision."" Gentiloni is a founding member of Italy's Democratic party, whose stances are largely described as a social democratic, center-left and Europeanist. Italy is currently led by a euroskeptic coalition whose largest parties are the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement and the right-wing Lega party.
 
 'Italy is not an African country'
 
 Western critics warn of Chinese debt traps and describe the initiative as a ploy to expand geopolitical and strategic influence, while Beijing pursues links to Europe and Africa via South Asia and the Middle East to expedite and increase the export of Chinese goods. German foreign minister Heiko Maas criticized Italy's decision on Sunday, telling local media: ""If some countries believe that they can do clever business with the Chinese, then they will be surprised when they wake up and find themselves dependent."" Still, in defense of his country, Gentiloni dismissed concerns that Italy would become economically beholden to China in the way that some African and South Asian nations have. ""Italy is not an African country … We will not have a Chinese invasion after these agreements,"" he said, pointing out that Italy has less Chinese inward investment than the U.K. or Germany. ""We have to be very cautious especially in issues connected to security, telecommunications, but I don't think these agreements economically will change much in the framework we have.""
 
 Indeed, Italy is not an African country — it has a higher debt-to-GDP ratio and far lower growth than most countries on the African continent. Its economy dipped into recession at the end of last year, and the deadly collapse of its Genoa Bridge last August cast a stark spotlight on its dire need for infrastructure investment.

 Another European country is weighing the possibility of joining China's international infrastructure investment plan. Malta, a small country in the Mediterranean that's part of the European Union, has indicated there's a possibility that it could join China's Belt and Road Initiative. In an exclusive interview, Edward Scicluna, the country's finance minister, said that ""certain prejudices"" should not come in the way of good business. ""One has to be wary of any country, especially with political ambitions or any sort of ambitions, but that's life,"" Scicluna told CNBC in Brussels. The Belt and Road scheme is meant to create a vast global network of land, sea and digital connections linking China with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa. Critics say the unprecedented infrastructure plan will favor Chinese firms, boost Beijing's international influence and force developing nations to take on high debt burdens.
 
 ""You have to be careful, but it doesn't mean you say no to any business, because of certain prejudices, or this, or that, or because someone is pressuring you. For a country to survive and to be competitive, especially a small country, we need to have diversification,"" Scicluna said. Earlier this month, Italy — the euro zone's third-largest economy — signaled its interest in joining the Chinese plan. Other European countries, namely Greece and Portugal, have also been supportive of Beijing's efforts. But there's much less support for Beijing's global investment push in the U.S. The White House has previously said Italy's potential involvement in the BRI could hurt its international reputation, according to the Financial Times. ""I have heard the alarm being raised from the United States,"" Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi di Maio said Sunday. ""Let it be clear that, if we are looking at the Silk Road towards China for our exports, it is not to strike a political deal with China, but only to help our companies,"" he said, according to Reuters. Speaking to CNBC, Malta's finance chief said the issue of the BRI is still quite new and ""very sensitive."" ""One should not invite a fight, definitely not ... But on the other hand, as a region we are sovereign, we have our own interests and we should look at that first.""

 Critics say that through the project, China forces developing nations to take on high debt burdens while benefiting Chinese companies which are often state-owned.
 
 Chinese President Xi Jinping 's regional infrastructure investment program is widely seen as Beijing's attempt to expand its influence globally through the construction of a network of land and maritime routes across Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
 
 Italy is planning to officially announce its support for China 's Belt and Road Initiative this month, the Financial Times reported Wednesday. It would be the first endorsement by a G-7 nation, the report pointed out.
 
 Italy's undersecretary in the economic development ministry, Michele Geraci, told the Financial Times his country is in negotiations to sign a memorandum of understanding in support of the program. The plan is to sign in time for Xi's visit by the end of March, Geraci said in the article.
 
 ""We want to make sure that 'Made in Italy' products can have more success in terms of export volume to China, which is the fastest-growing market in the world,"" he added in the report.
 
 Such public support would come at a critical time in China's relations with the U.S. and the European Union, of which Italy is a founding member.
 
 Xi is expected to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump by the end of March to clinch a deal to end their trade impasse. This week, the EU Council adopted its first-ever framework of rules on foreign direct investment, amid a rise of Chinese investments in the region and concerns about protection of key technologies.
 
 Garrett Marquis, White House National Security Council spokesperson, told the FT that the U.S. is skeptical of the benefits to Italy from an endorsement of the Chinese initiative, and urged allies and partners to increase the pressure on Beijing to align its global investments with international practices.
 
 A representative from the Italian embassy in Beijing was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

 Xi's Belt and Road Initiative, as it is formally called, envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending.
 
 But it has proved controversial in many Western capitals, particularly Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and saddle countries with unsustainable debt through non-transparent projects.
 
 The United States has been particularly critical of Italy's decision to sign up to the plan this month, during Xi's visit to Rome, the first for a G7 nation.
 
 Speaking to the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, Yang Jiechi, who runs the party's foreign affairs committee, said he had noted that some in the international community believed this was a geopolitical tool and would only bring debt traps for participating countries.
 
 ""This obviously shows a lack of objectivity and fair understanding of the Belt and Road initiative. It is a misunderstanding, misjudgment and is even prejudiced,"" wrote Yang, a former foreign minister and ambassador to Washington.
 
 China has stressed many times that the Belt and Road is to promote joint development, he added.
 
 ""The Belt and Road is open, inclusive and transparent. It does not play little geopolitical games. It does not engage in the exclusion of exclusive small circles.""
 
 Yang noted that many countries, companies and ordinary people participating in the Belt and Road project had ""publicly refuted rumors"" about it being a debt trap.
 
 Belt and Road projects, from their selection to their financing, go through careful risk assessments and the initiative's principles stress sustainable development, he said.
 
 ""For cooperative partners who have debt difficulties, China's principle is to appropriately resolve this through friendly consultations, and has never pushed or forced debt"" on anyone, Yang added.
 
 To date no participating country has faced a debt crisis — to the contrary many countries have been able to escape the ""no development trap"", he wrote.
 
 China will hold its second Belt and Road summit in Beijing in late April.
 
 Yang said almost 40 foreign leaders would take part, but did not name them. Some of China's closest allies have already confirmed they will come, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.","['initiative', 'countries', 'countrys', 'critics', 'debt', 'minister', 'belt', 'development', 'diplomat', 'chinas', 'yang', 'president', 'foreign', 'participating', 'prejudiced', 'road']","{'China': 6, 'Italy': 1, 'Cambodia': 1, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Philippines': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 Beijing offered in the last week a nod to criticism about its Belt and Road Initiative saddling other countries with debt while also gaining a partner in one of the world's financial centers. Swiss President Ueli Maurer met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday and signed a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on trade, investment and finance for projects in third countries along the routes of Xi's signature foreign investment program. The central European country has a reputation of being an international leader in banking. ""I think it is helpful that China can engage more European countries for the BRI,"" said Zhu Ning, professor of finance at Tsinghua University in Beijing. ""Switzerland would provide very important help to BRI given (the) Swiss's advantage in global banking and financial services.""
 
 That comes as Beijing seeks to recoup the image of the Belt and Road, which has been tarnished by criticism it's a vehicle for ""debt-trap diplomacy."" ""The accumulating debt involved in the BRI has prompted China to think more carefully about the sustainability of the BRI projects and how to combine the power of the state and the market to make it work, for Chinese and global participants,"" Zhu said. ""This becomes an even more important and pressing issue given that RMB internationalization process is not going as fast as a few years ago and it will post some challenges to China's currently mighty foreign reserve."" The Belt and Road Initiative is widely seen as Beijing's effort to increase global influence, beginning with the construction of rail, sea and other transportation routes stretching from central Asia to Africa. The projects can provide needed infrastructure. But critics say Chinese companies, often state-owned, tend to benefit more since they are usually the contractors or providers of financing. That puts China in control of overseas assets if a country can't pay back its loans. Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo called some of China's lending practices with other countries ""predatory.""
 
 While it is encouraging that Chinese officials are talking more openly about prioritizing debt sustainability and environmental sustainability, real change will require more than signing symbolic documents. Jonathan Hillman Director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
 
 The U.S. and India, another country critical of the Chinese-led program, did not send official representatives to the second Belt and Road forum that concluded in Beijing this past weekend. Thirty-seven national leaders attended the event, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Xi used his opening speech to acknowledge some of program's shortcomings in its first six years of existence. Analysts also noted that he did not make any pronouncements on China's financial commitment to Belt and Road. ""We need to pursue high standard cooperation to improve people's lives and promote sustainable development,"" Xi said, according to an official English translation of his Mandarin Chinese remarks. ""We also need to ensure the commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects so that they will achieve the intended goals as planned."" A day before Xi's speech, China's Ministry of Finance released a ""Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative."" The document provides optional guidelines for making loans and a mathematical formula for determining a country's ability to handle debt.
 
 Marie Diron, managing director at Sovereign Risk Group, Moody's Investors Service, said in an emailed statement on Friday that the framework is ""comprehensive"" and is based on principles similar to what other institutions use for trying to ensure a level of debt isn't excessive. ""Applied effectively, it may help reduce the financial stability risks that some borrowing countries face from the additional debt burden incurred from Belt and Road projects,"" Diron said. ""The framework's effectiveness will depend on how widely it is applied, since it is not a mandatory tool, the borrowing governments' capacity to provide the necessary inputs to the debt sustainability analysis and the lending banks' use of the tool in their decisions."" Chinese financial institutions have provided more than $440 billion in funding for Belt and Road projects, People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said during a talk at the forum, according to an English-language release on Chinese state media. ""A country's overall debt capacity should be taken into account as a way to control debt risks and ensure sustainability of debt when it comes to the investment decisions,"" Yi said. He added that future financing and investment cooperation should be market-oriented and mostly from commercial funds.

 The agreement Switzerland signed is technically between the country's federal departments of finance and economic affairs, education and research, and China's National Development and Reform Commission. The memorandum lists initiatives to connect Swiss, Chinese and third-party leaders to create business deals and establish a ""Belt and Road Initiative competence-building platform"" in Switzerland.

 Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative is now about far more than just infrastructure. The program began roughly six years ago with a focus on building out rail and maritime trade routes connecting China with central Asia, Europe and Africa. While critics have charged that the initiative is simply a branding exercise for Beijing to spread its global influence through lending — and the associated debt — for projects like ports and bridges, Xi has now made it clear he's aiming even further. That is, the second Belt and Road Forum that wrapped up this weekend in Beijing demonstrated that the China-led program now seeks to influence technology and governance around the world. ""There will be a shift away from ... hard infrastructure projects,"" Tom Rafferty, principal economist for China at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said Friday. ""(The Belt and Road is) going to have a broader range.""

 In fact, Rafferty said, the Chinese leader demonstrated that he sees the program ""as a China global governance initiative."" Xi's speech at the forum's opening ceremony on Friday proclaimed that, through the Belt and Road, China would ""strengthen cooperation in customs, taxation and audit oversight"" and pursue cooperation on technological development. The joint communique released at the conclusion of the forum also said Belt and Road participants ""aim to enhance connectivity among financial markets"" and encourage the development of digital infrastructure. Although it's always been difficult to pin down the exact nature of the Belt and Road Initiative, the latest pronouncements indicate how Beijing is, as many had expected, using the program as a way to expand its global influence.

 Delays and cancellations
 
 Since April 2018, several BRI projects have encountered delays, suspension, or outright cancellations ""due to skepticism and pushback against the project,"" according to an August report by The Economist Intelligence Unit. News emerged this week that Islamabad had requested Beijing in December to shelve a joint $2 billion coal power project. That comes after Pakistan's Railways Minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad said in October that his country would be reducing Chinese loans for rail projects from $8.2 billion to $6.2 billion. Myanmar's government also cut down the price for a Chinese-backed deepwater port in the conflict-ridden state of Rakhine from $7.3 billion to $1.3 billion, Reuters reported last year, citing concerns the initial cost would leave the Southeast Asian nation in a lot of debt. Sierra Leone, one of Africa's poorest countries, also scrapped plans to build a $318-million airport with a Chinese company last year while Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed has suspended $22 billion worth of Chinese-backed projects. Early last year, Bangladesh canceled an expansion of a major highway that was meant to be built by China Harbour Engineering Company after the Chinese firm allegedly offered a government official a bribe, AFP quoted the South Asian state's finance minister as saying. And Tanzania reopened negotiations with Beijing last year over a planned $11 billion port. Many of these countries want to avoid the same fate as Sri Lanka. Shock waves rippled throughout the developing world when Colombo handed over a strategic port to Beijing in 2017, after it couldn't pay off its debt to Chinese companies. It was seen as an example of how countries that owe money to Beijing could be forced to sign over national territory or make steep economic concessions if they can't meet liabilities. The phenomenon has been dubbed debt-trap diplomacy, which Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has denied engaging in.

 ""The capacity to take on debt to invest allows countries to grow faster, but only if they invest well,"" Joachim von Amsberg, vice president of policy and strategy at the China-led investment bank told CNBC on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum. A project's ability to generate strong economic returns should be the biggest determining factor for governments, he added.
 
 His comments come as criticism mounts on China's globe-spanning infrastructure program known as the Belt and Road Initiative.
 
 One of the biggest complaints about the project is its reliance on Chinese workers and unsustainable loans which many participating nations may not be able to afford in the long term.
 
 If emerging economies can't generate enough cash to pay the interest on China's loans, Beijing may seek economic or political concessions as compensation as was the case with Sri Lanka.

 The 93-year-old leader, who marks his first 100 days in office this weekend, has repeatedly criticized Chinese ventures for being too expensive and not supporting Malaysian labor. He lands in Beijing on Friday and will be in the country until next Tuesday.
 
 A former authoritarian leader who first ruled Malaysia from 1981 to 2003, Mahathir took his predecessor Najib Razak to task over the issue, accusing the scandal-ridden politician of ""selling off"" the country in exchange for Beijing's help in settling debts linked to troubled state fund 1MDB. Kuala Lumpur has received billions through the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping's continent-spanning infrastructure venture.
 
 Mahathir, the world's oldest prime minister, has also suspended three China-backed projects worth around $22 billion — two gas pipelines and a rail link — that were signed under Najib's watch.

 Along with others in Africa, Uganda has received large credit lines from China in recent years as part of the Asian giant's so-called Belt and Road Initiative, aimed at rebuilding the old Silk Road connection with Asia, Europe and beyond.
 
 However U.S. officials have been critical of Belt and Road lending, which they say can leave countries with excessive debt.
 
 Construction of the so-called oil roads would accelerate efforts to commence crude oil production in Uganda, which has failed to take off 14 years after crude reserves were discovered in the country's west.
 
 The money will be borrowed from China's Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, according to a statement issued by the government that listed decisions taken at a cabinet meeting on Monday.
 
 The statement said the roads are needed to ""facilitate the efficient development and production of the strategic national oil resources"". It did not give details on the total length of roads to be built.
 
 Uganda's oil fields are in the Albertine rift basin near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Reserves are estimated at 6 billion barrels.
 
 France's Total co-owns the fields in equal stakes with China's CNOOC and UK's Tullow Oil.
 
 Crude production has been repeatedly delayed over the years by spats over taxes and a lack of requisite infrastructure like tarmac roads in the fields, a crude export pipeline and a refinery.
 
 A new impasse over taxes on Tullow's planned divestment of part of its stake in the fields is seen as potentially pushing the production target of 2022 to a later date.
 
 Last week the IMF cut its economic growth projection for Uganda for the July 2019 to June 2020 financial year, citing tardy progress with oil production.
 
 The Washington, DC-based institution also warned Ugandan authorities to exercise fiscal discipline and maintain debt sustainability.
 
 Uganda's public debt, the IMF calculates, is expected to hit the key benchmark of 50% of GDP as early as the 2021/22 financial year.

 BEIJING, Jan 16 (Reuters) - China's Belt and Road investment scheme, which aims to connect Europe with Asia, is sidelining European companies and Brussels should review its competition law to level the playing field, a business lobby group said on Thursday.
 
 Opaque procurement processes and the dominance of giant state-owned Chinese companies mean European companies get only ""crumbs from the table,"" the European Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report.
 
 It said the European Union should move to force Chinese companies that access the EU procurement market to operate under the same restrictions that EU companies do in China.
 
 ""If the EU fails to play an active and competitive role, there is a real danger that it could eventually become little more than a peripheral market tacked on to the end of Eurasia,"" the Chamber of Commerce said.
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) seeks to build a modern version of the Silk Road to link China with Asia, Europe and beyond through large-scale infrastructure projects that it has launched in more than 60 countries since 2013.
 
 European companies are merely ""niche players"" in the BRI, with just 20 chamber members of 132 survey respondents reporting that they had bid on BRI projects, chamber President Joerg Wuttke told reporters on Monday ahead of the report's release.
 
 Those European companies that did get involved did so mainly through Chinese business partners or the government, and usually their role was to provide specific technologies or expertise that the Chinese side lacked, the report said.
 
 Both Chinese and foreign companies can participate in BRI projects through open, transparent means, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily briefing in Beijing on Thursday. Many European firms have participated in the BRI, he said.
 
 Chinese national champions were also gaining ""monopolistic power"" in some BRI countries by building digital infrastructure that involved complete packages of software and hardware based on Chinese standards, according to the Chamber's report.
 
 Such companies benefited from heavy state support at home, which helped them beat international competitors.
 
 ""Smaller, less developed countries that do not have the capacity for setting their own standards will certainly be put under considerable pressure to simply adopt Chinese standards,"" the report said.
 
 The EU needed to allow its own companies to scale up by reviewing its competition law, it said. The EU's own infrastructure initiative, the ""Connectivity Strategy,"" should also be prioritised as a ""credible alternative"" to the BRI.

 China's ambitious plan to recreate the old Silk Road trading routes across Eurasia and is facing a serious financing challenge, according to the country's senior bankers and government researchers.
 
 Speaking on Thursday at a forum in Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong province, Li Ruogu, the former president of Export-Import Bank of China, said that most of the countries along the route of the ""Belt and Road Initiative"", as the plan is known, did not have the money to pay for the projects with which they were involved.
 
 Many were already heavily in debt and needed ""sustainable finance"" and private investment, he said, adding that the countries' average liability and debt ratios had reached 35 and 126 per cent, respectively, far above the globally recognized warning lines of 20 and 100 per cent.
 
 ""It would be a tremendous task to raise funds for the countries' development,"" Li said.

 Six Chinese who survived Titanic disaster finally have their story told
 
 China's new central bank chief Yi Gang said on Thursday that Beijing was keen to work with international organisations, commercial lenders, and financial centers like Hong Kong and London to diversify funding sources for the plan.
 
 Wang Yiming, deputy head of the Development Research Centre of China's State Council, said at the forum that although many belt and road projects were funded by major financial institutions — including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, New Development Bank, China Development Bank (CDB), the Export-Import Bank of China and the Silk Road Fund — there was still a huge funding gap of up to US$500 billion a year.
 
 The limited participation of private investors, narrow financing channels and low profitability levels were major problems, Wang said.
 
 ""Countries involved in belt and road projects have low financial capabilities and high liability ratios"" he said. ""It is important to encourage financial innovation to raise funds to support the development of the belt and road.""
 
 He called for the creation of an international fundraising mechanism to attract private investors, and a separate system to measure the credit risks associated with each project.
 
 Li said that private investors were also often put off by the complexity of having to deal with the different tax regimes, labor laws, customs clearance procedures and currencies of belt and road host nations.
 
 To make the financing propositions more appealing, local governments should consider copying China's model and offer preferential policies to foreign investors, he said.
 
 Liu Yong, chief economist at CDB — the nation's main policy lender — said the bank always considered the medium to long-term risks faced by Chinese companies involved in belt and road projects.
 
 While there were ""non-performing asset problems"" with some schemes, they were ""within our tolerance range"", he said.
 
 The credit ratings of all countries and projects ""were carefully and jointly evaluated"", he said.
 
 On the issue of CEFC China Energy, one of CDB's highest profile clients, which is in serious financial trouble after the disappearance of its chairman, Ye Jianming, Liu acknowledged the public concerns but declined to make any further comments.

 China's ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure initiative elevates sovereign debt risks in eight countries involved in the massive cross-continent plan, a new study has found. Of the 68 countries identified as potential borrowers in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) — a sprawling plan aimed at connecting China with much of Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa — 23 were found to be already at a ""quite high"" risk of debt distress, according to the Washington-based Center for Global Development (CGD), a think tank. Among those names was Sri Lanka, which made the news in December when it handed over control of Hambantota port — a facility built using Chinese loans — to China Merchants Port Holdings, a state-owned port operator.
 
 Eight could have problems servicing debt
 
 The think tank determined that eight of those 23 countries would potentially face difficulties in servicing their debt because of future financing related to BRI projects. Those countries include Pakistan, Djibouti, the Maldives, Laos, Mongolia, Montenegro, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Pakistan is a major part of the infrastructure scheme, playing home to the Gwadar Port, which is one of several notable developments in the region that make up the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. According to the think tank, these eight countries highlighted would see their levels of external debt owed to China and its bank rise ""sometimes dramatically,"" thanks to the Belt and Road scheme, which plans to invest as much as $8 trillion in infrastructure projects across Asia, Europe and Africa. Pakistan is by far the largest country at high risk, with China reportedly financing about 80 percent of its estimated US$62 billion in additional debt.
 
 ""Big-ticket BRI projects and the relatively high interest rates being charged by China add to Pakistan's risk of debt distress,"" CGD said. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Another is Laos in Southeast Asia, which has several BRI-linked projects. This includes a $6.7 billion China-Laos railway which represents nearly half the country's GDP — leading the International Monetary Fund to warn that it might threaten the country's ability to service its debts, the think tank noted. The elevated risks were in part due to China's record of dealing with debt relief in the past. CGD called its track record ""problematic"", saying: ""Unlike the world's other leading government creditors, China has not signed on to a binding set of rules of the road when it comes to avoiding unsustainable lending and addressing debt problems when they arise.""

 Local judges blocked the plant’s construction on environmental grounds and finding that the project owner had failed to consult local communities. Through mediation, the Chinese investors and Kenyan government might have been able to come up with a mutually beneficial arrangement, experts contend.
 
 The scope of the BRI, a $1tn infrastructural programme, extends from the southern Pacific to Europe, Africa and Latin America. Through it, China aims to finance roads, ports and other infrastructure such as power stations in some of the world’s poorest areas.
 
 According to the World Bank, the potential network of BRI infrastructure would touch about 70 countries. While it may make for large scale economic opportunity, it also raises the possibility of myriad international commercial disputes.
 
 The Chinese government is looking, therefore, for ways to settle BRI disputes efficiently. This month, China was one of the first countries to sign the Singapore Convention, the new UN protocol on the enforcement of mediated settlement agreements.
 
 Meanwhile, the non-profit Singapore International Mediation Centre and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade — a Chinese state body charged with developing business co-operation with other countries — recently established an international panel of mediators to handle disagreements arising from BRI projects.
 
 The most actively developing market outside of the US right now is Asia
 
 Other dispute resolution bodies around the world have also recognised the importance of offering mediation to counterparties of BRI projects. The Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), whose international court of arbitration has resolved about 23,000 commercial disputes since its creation in 1923 — released guidance on mediation of BRI quarrels last year.
 
 The ICC has also set up a court commission to develop its approach to BRI disputes, headed by Hong Kong-based Justin D’Agostino, global head of disputes for law firm Herbert Smith Freehills. “Belt and Road presents a rare opportunity to rethink how complex multi-party, international disputes are resolved,” Mr D’Agostino wrote recently in a note to potential BRI counterparties.
 
 “For centuries, dispute resolution has been anchored to adversarial processes,” Mr D’Agostino added. “But there is a concerted effort to encourage mediation clauses in Belt and Road agreements, with provision for arbitration if mediation fails.”

 Styles and preferences for commercial dispute resolution often differ from culture to culture, says Jack Coe, international commercial arbitration masters programme faculty director at Pepperdine Law School near Los Angeles.
 
 Many business cultures prefer arbitration, he says, whereby an arbiter decides on the virtue, or otherwise, of quarrelling parties’ arguments. Some societies, meanwhile, may favour the use of potentially less combative methods of dispute resolution, such as mediation, in which parties involved reach voluntary agreement.
 
 Mediation has “been around for decades” in the US and UK as an alternative to arbitration or litigating disputes in the courts, says Mr Coe. The UK in particular, with its strong legal reputation and deep international ties with Commonwealth countries around the globe, has been a traditional hub for international commercial dispute resolution, including mediation.
 
 Mr Coe notes that in some legal cultures, “infrequent use of commercial mediation may reflect a preference for compulsory processes such as arbitration, that do not depend on voluntary participation to run their course”. Though, as he adds, it is “tough to speak in generalities because cultures aren’t monoliths and attitudes can vary from industry to industry”.
 
 Arbitration is still the norm in Asia, even though some Asian cultures have a reputation for consensus building, say lawyers in the region. “The reality is most people want to settle disputes amicably if they want an ongoing business relationship,” notes Jones Day Singapore partner Matthew Skinner. “So there is always a place for settlement.”
 
 In Europe, apart from London and Paris, Geneva is also popular. The dozens of international organisations hosted by the Swiss city include the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s arbitration and mediation centre, which is widely used for entertainment, technology and other IP disputes.
 
 Dubai is looking to establish itself as a centre for mediating disputes in the Middle East, says Mr Skinner. Disputes in the Gulf region are particularly common in large-scale construction projects involving multiple contractors.
 
 In the US, New York and Washington are traditional mediation centres, while Miami, with its long established Hispanic connections, is becoming an increasingly popular destination for Latin American counterparties to mediate disputes. Los Angeles-based Jams, which boasts of being the world’s largest private alternative dispute resolution provider, also offers cross border services with Latin America, which it runs out of Miami.
 
 Asia, however, is viewed as the growth area. “The most actively developing market outside of the US right now is Asia,” says Chris Poole, Jams chief executive. “That is why we have a representative in Beijing and a partner organisation in Shanghai,” he adds.
 
 China’s BRI and Singapore are key driving forces. Its eye on the future, the Singapore government has just finished the expansion of a dedicated alternative dispute resolution centre, the Maxwell Chambers Suites, in the city’s old traffic police headquarters.
 
 The centre is officially scheduled to have “the highest concentration of case management offices anywhere in the world”, in the full expectation of seeing “more high-value cross-border disputes managed in and out of Singapore”.","['rise', 'singapore', 'arbitration', 'set', 'resolution', 'mediation', 'commercial', 'mediations', 'belt', 'dispute', 'fuel', 'disputes', 'china', 'international', 'centre', 'bri', 'global', 'road']","{'China': 5, 'Hong Kong': 1, 'Kenya': 2, 'Singapore': 7, 'United States': 4}",,,,,

162,Time,https://time.com/4776845/china-xi-jinping-belt-road-initiative-obor/,-0.3,,USA,W,2017-05-12 00:00:00,China: 5 Facts on Xi Jinping's Belt &amp; Road Initiative Summit,"It’s championed by pliant academics in state newspapers, danced about by ethnically diverse children in propaganda videos, and financed by fretful bankers with little hope of recouping their investments: China’s Belt and Road Initiative is a leviathan transnational infrastructure scheme that’s hard to ignore.
 
 On Sunday, a two-day summit on President Xi Jinping’s keynote project opens in Beijing, attended by 1,500 delegates from 130 countries, including 29 heads of state and government. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte are the star names on show, and even North Korea is sending a delegation. (Though E.U. leaders are in relatively short supply.)
 
 In short, the Belt and Road Initiative (otherwise known as One Belt One Road, or OBOR) is a revival of the iconic land and maritime Silk Road via a trade and infrastructure network spanning East Asia to Western Europe and South through Africa. It consists of roads, railways, ports, pipelines and everything in between across a region with a $26 trillion infrastructure deficit, according to some estimates.
 
 The basic idea is to make it easier for China to trade with the world, at a time when its economy is slowing, with the happy corollary that the world will find it easier to trade with each other. But OBOR remains a nebulous, confusing concept, which offers enormous benefits but only if significant challenges can be negotiated.
 
 “Major concerns remain regarding the transparency of how China is financing these projects, and the extent to which China is able to manage security risks in OBOR countries,” says Nick Marro, China analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit.
 
 Here’s what you need to know:
 
 It’s big:
 
 OBOR covers 65% of the world’s population, three-quarters of global energy resources and 40% of GDP. China’s annual trade with OBOR countries already exceeds $1.4 trillion. But Beijing’s overlapping disputes in the South and East China Seas have fed suspicions that OBOR is a Trojan horse for extending its geopolitical clout.
 
 If so, China is backing that gambit with hard cash: The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor — connecting China’s westernmost city of Kashgar to Pakistan’s port city of Gwadar, some 2,000 miles away — will alone cost $46 billion. (By comparison, the U.S. has spent $33 billion in Pakistan since 2002, two-thirds on security.)
 
 Above all, OBOR signifies that China is embracing an international presence like never before, and the old isolationist adage of “hide your strength, bide your time,” coined by China’s reformist leader Deng Xiaoping, is very much a thing of the past. “The scale of China’s Belt and Road Initiative could eclipse the role of the G-7 or G-20 Forums as a new framework for stimulating infrastructure development in low income developing countries,” writes Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist for IHS Markit.
 
 It’s fuzzy:
 
 Even academics who have immersed themselves in OBOR since Xi Jinping unveiled the initiative in 2013 are unsure about the specific parameters. That’s maybe because there are none: any nation, company, organization anywhere is welcome to join OBOR, says Beijing — even the U.S.
 
 Only one official map of the project has been produced, though, and that was swiftly withdrawn, leaving analysts and the media to draft their own based upon dribs and drabs of solid information. “Almost anything now can be counted as Belt and Road,” Tom Miller, author of China’s Asia Dream: Empire Building Along the New Silk Road, told a recent talk at the Foreign Correspondent’s Club of China.
 
 It’s political:
 
 Before President Donald Trump nixed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, OBOR was seen as Beijing’s rival to that Washington-led free trade pact, which Beijing opted not to join. Some say that China’s offer to help build ports and railways across the region is just a cynical ploy to shift excess capacity overseas, particularly steel. The numbers don’t support that — China’s overcapacity is simply too big — though there are clear geopolitical and security benefits from China diversifying its energy resources.
 
 Currently, up to 80% of China’s oil arrives via the Strait of Malacca, thus is vulnerable to blockade in time of war or other crises. New pipelines through Central Asia, Myanmar and Pakistan therefore make strategic sense. As does the idea of strengthening connectivity across Asia, with China very much at its beating heart. “Writing off OBOR is a big mistake,” says Professor Nick Bisley, an Asia expert at Australia’s La Trobe University. “It speaks to a leadership vision that is very Chinese.”
 
 It’s expensive:
 
 OBOR consists of $900 billion of planned investments, making it probably the grandest investment drive put forward by a single country. In 2015, China transferred $82 billion to three state-owned banks for OBOR projects. It also set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) primarily to fund OBOR, of which the $100 billion of initial capital may be doubled soon.
 
 But doubts remain over the financing: Crucially, Xi unveiled OBOR when raw commodity prices were high, thus exploiting hitherto untapped supplies in Central Asia made sense. But today’s historic low prices stamp a big question mark over the economic viability of these projects.
 
 In addition, the political expedience of supporting OBOR means that many seemingly unrelated projects are jumping on the bandwagon in the hopes of securing easy funding. That opens the door for projects that “don’t fit with the government’s strategy or perhaps accelerate systemic risks,” says Nicholas Consonery, a China specialist at FTI Consulting. “Or maybe they are just bad investments.”
 
 It’s not plain sailing:
 
 Back when Marco Polo was meandering to the Far East in the 13th century, Asian trade routes were on the whole freely navigable. Today, however, festering conflicts pepper China’s western flank — including Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of Myanmar, as well as farther afield in Ukraine and the Middle East. China’s own westernmost region of Xinjiang, key to nearly all of the Belt part of the OBOR, is also prone to strife.
 
 Already, a Chinese-financed port in Sri Lanka has been postponed following deadly protests, and the Indian government is rumbling about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes though disputed Kashmir. That project is a key part of OBOR, potentially slashing the time of transporting goods from eastern Chinese factories to the Middle East from 12 days to 36 hours. But other than Kashmir, the route also snakes past Taliban territory and Baloch insurgents.
 
 The big question is how will China protect its investment. Are we going to see Chinese boots on the ground? That’s a prospect that would radically reform the region’s security architecture. “We don’t really know much about co-financing in the host governments, and the kinds of debts and repayments that are going to be involved,” says Carlyle Thayer, emeritus professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy. “And all that infrastructure spanning out from Western China can be hostage to instability.”

163,Time,https://time.com/4992103/china-silk-road-belt-xi-jinping-khorgos-kazakhstan-infrastructure/,-0.3,,USA,W,2017-10-23 00:00:00,China: New Silk Road Is a Challenge for Washington,"On China’s remote western frontier with Kazakhstan, yurts and camels are silhouetted against a piercing blue sky. Yet the most striking image rising from the desert is an entirely new city. Founded four years ago, Khorgos is poised to become the world’s busiest inland port, a vital link in China’s multi-billion dollar plan to re-create the Silk Road.
 
 Some $8 billion of trade passes through each year, say Chinese officials. There’s a free-trade zone that welcomes 30,000 traders daily, and an industrial complex of factories where manufacturers enjoy perks such as two years of free rent courtesy of the Chinese government. At the customs gate, trucks line up stacked with agricultural equipment and huge cross sections of blue industrial piping, as blurry-eyed drivers chain-smoke out of their cab windows.
 
 “Today, the ground of Khorgos is mud,” says Guo Jianbin, deputy director of the Khorgos Economic Development Zone administration committee, accenting his words with a booted stamp. “But soon it will be paved with gold.”
 
 Khorgos is a linchpin in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative. Formerly known as One Belt One Road, it’s a rekindling of the ancient Silk Road through a staggeringly ambitious plan to build a network of highways, railways and pipelines linking Asia via the Middle East to Europe and south through Africa. The economic land “belt” takes cargo, in large part via Khorgos, through Eurasia. A maritime “road” links coastal Chinese cities via a series of ports to Africa and the Mediterranean. A total of 900 separate projects have been earmarked at a cost of $900 billion, according to the China Development Bank. There’s the $480 million Lamu deep-sea port in Kenya, which will eventually be connected via road, railway and pipeline to landlocked South Sudan and Ethiopia and right across Africa to Cameroon’s port of Douala. A new $7.3 billion pipeline from Turkmenistan will bring China an extra 15 billion cubic meters of gas annually. Not since the hordes of Genghis Khan galloped west in the 13th century have such sweeping transnational ambitions emanated from China, though instead of ashes and sun-bleached bones, this time the invaders plan to leave harbors, pipelines and high-speed rail in its wake.
 
 “Exchange will replace estrangement, mutual learning will replace clashes, and coexistence will replace a sense of superiority,” Xi told the opening of the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing in May.
 
 It’s a vision of inclusive globalization that bolsters Chinese leadership credentials at a time when the U.S. is wavering on its international commitments. Belt and Road spans some 65 countries, covering 70% of the planet’s population, three-quarters of its energy resources, a quarter of goods and services and 28% of global GDP—some $21 trillion. Beijing’s rationale is clear: these are large, resource-rich nations within its reach, with a severe infrastructure deficit, which China has the resources and expertise to correct. By boosting connectivity, China can spur growth in the short term, gain access to valuable natural resources in the mid term and create new booming markets for its goods long into the future.
 
 In March, China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said Chinese firms had already contributed 180,000 jobs and nearly $1.1 billion in tax revenue along the Belt and Road. Increasing numbers of Chinese engineers, crane operators and steel smelters stand to reap the benefits of maturing projects.

 “You’ll have a China that really sits at the beating heart strategically and economically of this most important part of the world,” says professor Nick Bisley, an Asia expert at Australia’s La Trobe University.
 
 For Xi, that’s the rightful position of the world’s most populous nation, boasting its second-biggest economy after that of the U.S. China’s recent history has lurched from colonization to devastating war and then collectivized economic turmoil, poverty and political strife. No longer. Today, Chinese companies own storied European soccer teams, a major Hollywood film studio and New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel. China has the most solar panels, wind turbines, and high-speed rail in the world. When, in January, Xi became the first Chinese leader to address the World Economic Forum in Davos, he presented an image of a confident, globalist, responsible statesman, helping to set international rules of trade and environmental standards.
 
 This vision contrasts starkly with U.S. President Donald Trump, who can’t pass his own $1 trillion plan to rebuild the nation’s crumbling roads, bridges and electricity grid, despite the vast majority of Americans recognizing the urgent need. Trump’s nixing of American involvement in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, and open questioning of key Asian alliances, have weakened the U.S. as a Pacific power. Trump’s stalled attempts to renegotiate NAFTA have irked neighbors Canada and Mexico, while his announcement of America’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord has left the world looking to China for leadership on this and other issues.

 Restoring the lost grandeur of the Silk Road has myriad challenges, of course, chiefly the questionable economics of pouring millions of dollars into some of the world’s poorest and most unstable nations. Falling commodity prices have undermined some projects, while others are vulnerable to crises or shifting political winds in host countries.
 
 The scale of the challenge is evident in Khorgos, through which trains now chug on a 7,000-mile journey from 27 Chinese manufacturing hubs to 11 cities in Europe. It’s the world’s longest international freight line, broadly following the path of the old Silk Road caravans that lugged pistachios, ivory and dates to eager markets in the West. Guo says 2,050 cargo trains passed by Khorgos last year, and the goal for 2017 is 5,000.
 
 Khorgos sits on the edge of the Taklamakan Desert, nicknamed the “Sea of Death.” Herodotus wrote in his Histories of griffins guarding golden treasure at the desert’s craggy northern extreme, and of the North Wind gushing from a mountain cave here. Lying just 100 miles from the Eurasian pole of inaccessibility—the farthest point on earth from any ocean—Khorgos remains one of the most remote spots on earth
 
 Today, the Taklamakan fills part of China’s westernmost autonomous region of Xinjiang, which borders seven Central and South Asian nations and is thus the central hub for Belt and Road’s land portion. A total of 3,500 miles of the ancient Silk Road passes through this Alaska-sized territory, where the Taklamakan’s dunes to the south are separated from a lush northern prairie by a central spine of meringue-peaked mountains.
 
 But Xinjiang is also China’s most volatile region, prone to periodic convulsions of strife from a predominantly ethnic Uighur Muslim population that feels marginalized and even persecuted under Beijing’s rule. Riots in the provincial capital Urumqi in 2009 left 197 dead, according to official figures. Security is suffocating. To take a train at the Urumqi’s railway station requires negotiating four ranks of X-ray machines and metal detectors. At the city’s central bazaar, soldiers stand next to armored cars with bayonets affixed to assault rifles, as lambs are carried bleating and blinking past trays of mutton into butcher shops. It’s China’s only province without 4G cell-phone coverage—deliberately held back to impede the download of jihadi propaganda, say local officials.
 
 In the especially restive south, Uighurs must secure official permission just to travel to neighboring villages. Many feel development isn’t inclusive. “Things were better before,” says a Uighur taxi driver in Khorgos, whose name TIME has withheld for his own security. “In the winter I would hunt wild turkey; in the summer I picked berries. We don’t need all this.”

 Security is not just a domestic issue. Pipelines and dams in Myanmar, ports in Western Africa, hydro-electricity plants and copper mines in Afghanistan could all be held ransom to strife. Last year, Chinese railway workers in Kenya were attacked by locals who said the new arrivals had been unfairly prioritized for jobs. China may feel compelled to expand its military presence in trouble spots, shifting the global security architecture away from the U.S. In August, China opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti, and it now contributes more U.N. peacekeepers than the other four permanent Security Council members combined.
 
 “Security is the most important challenge facing Belt and Road,” says Zhu Feng, dean of the Institute of International Affairs at Nanjing University.
 
 Economic questions also plague many aspects of the initiative. The ancient Silk Road faded in importance in the 1700s as more sophisticated ships began plying sea routes crammed with booty. Today, trains through Khorgos haul more than 80 standard shipping containers and stretching a half-mile long. But modern ships are powered by 110,000 horsepower engines and carry up to 20,000 containers.
 
 The rail line via Khorgos to Europe is two to three times the cost of sea freight, with twice the carbon footprint, while only cutting transport times from eastern Chinese factories to Europe in half—18 days compared to 35 by sea. There are few goods that would benefit from this time-saving for the extra cost: perishable fruit or pharmaceuticals are flown by airplane to minimize spoilage; electronics or imperishable household wares are dispatched by the cheapest method possible to maximize profits. Compounding matters, while China sends clothes, electronics and building materials through Khorgos to the West, those same “cargo trains are coming back empty,” says the official Guo. Europe isn’t a cost-effective destination, and the economies of Central Asia are weak. At the Khorgos free-trade zone, only 10% of traders come from Kazakhstan. While the Chinese browse mink furs, Georgian red wine and Siberian honey, the Kazakhs queue for rust-bucket minibuses clutching plastic chairs, cheap bedding and counterfeit sneakers.
 
 “Ninety-nine percent of our customers are Chinese,” says Lian Gang, the manager of a duty-free shop in the trade zone.
 
 The marine “road” faces its own impediments. China’s ports had excess capacity of 50 million containers in 2013, according the think tank International Transport Forum, bigger than the combined volume handled by Japan, Russia, Taiwan and South Korea. But the current surge of new port construction, combined with slowing Chinese exports, means excess capacity will likely double by 2030.

 Xi’s personal patronage of Belt and Road means many questionable projects are getting the green light due to political expedience rather than economic need. A new railway through landlocked Laos, for one, is set to cost $7 billion—about half of the country’s GDP. Some 70% is to be funded by Chinese investment with the rest paid for by the Laotian government, largely through loans provided by a consortium of Chinese state banks. The isolated nation of 7 million will never be a competitive manufacturing hub.
 
 According to Erica Downs, a China specialist at nonprofit research and analysis organization CNA, who has spent four years researching the initiative, “If you can link whatever you are doing to Belt and Road, even if it’s a tenuous connection, there’s still a chance of securing financial support.” State Chinese banks are obliged to support government initiatives with low-interest loans. Wary bankers have started referring to “One Belt One Trap.”
 
 When Xi first announced the initiative in Almaty in 2013, commodity prices were at historic highs. But they have now fallen precipitously. China is, of course, big enough to handle a few white elephants. Its meteoric rise over the last three decades was engineered on exactly this massive state-championed approach to financing, and it has the resources. Its GDP was $11.2 trillion last year, with growth at a slowing though healthy 6.7%, and a trade surplus of $48.5 billion in August 2017. In total, the Silk Road Fund—comprising injections Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), New Development Bank, China Development Bank, Export-Import Bank of China and the nation’s humanitarian aid coffers—adds up to $269 billion.
 
 But the rest of the estimated $900 billion for the initiative must come via private Chinese banks and contributions by host countries. Beijing has enormous centralized power to get things done, including offering myriad incentives for business that embrace Belt and Road. Still, there is the danger that is has gone too far.
 
 “The Chinese are very possibly taking on commitments that will exceed their ability to fund in a period of dramatically slowing growth,” says Scott W. Harold, a China expert for RAND Corp.
 
 Of course, it might not matter whether most projects offer substantial returns. Infrastructure is inherently a positive, regardless of whether its financiers handsomely recoup their investment. Roads, bridges and tunnels link communities and boost commerce. The Asian Development Bank says Asia needs $26 trillion of infrastructure through 2030, or $1.7 trillion per year. Try telling rural Indonesians that a new power plant, which will let their children study into the night, is a bad idea. Or Sudanese farmers that the road or railway that will take their crops to market is an expensive folly. Many Belt and Road countries are so poor that even a tiny injection of capital can make a massive difference to livelihoods.

 Above all, the new Silk Road is a geopolitical gambit.
 
 The Chinese-financed Hambantota Port in southern Sri Lanka has been vastly underused since it opened in 2010, prompting the Colombo government in July to sell a 70% stake to state-run China Merchants Port Holdings for $1.1 billion. India is now worried that the port will be used to host Chinese naval vessels.
 
 The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is about befriending Pakistan so it stops extremists seeping over into Xinjiang.
 
 Meanwhile, the AIIB, the new Beijing-headquartered multilateral development bank, was established in 2016 to fund Belt and Road projects but also to show the world that China can run a real, multilateral development bank according to international standards. Washington made fierce attempts to persuade nations not to join it, but few listened and 80 nations arenow members, including staunch U.S. allies Australia and Britain.
 
 “When the Chinese government proposed the idea there was some misunderstanding, and some questions and even suspicions,” AIIB president Jin Liqun tells TIME in his Beijing office. “Misunderstanding is understandable. It takes time for people to appreciate the concept.”
 
 America remains in denial about what Belt and Road really signifies. In a June report, the State Department commented that the Initiative’s free-trade zones “only offer a degree of [liberalization] comparable to other opportunities in other parts of China” and not much else. The U.S. sent a low-level delegation to the May forum in Beijing. Chinese state media reported in June that Trump told a senior Beijing official he was open to cooperating on the initiative, though the White House wouldn’t confirm those remarks. Then, on October 3, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis criticized the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor for passing through disputed Kashmir, parroting India’s objections and appearing to side with New Delhi on the intractable territorial wrangle.
 
 “In a globalized world, there are many belts and many roads, and no one nation should put itself into a position of dictating ‘one belt, one road,’” Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee during a congressional hearing.
 
 The new Silk Road is the purest illustration of Beijing’s budding influence as Washington is consumed with partisan bickering and fumbles for a coherent foreign policy. China has wrapped an amorphous group of projects in a tidy package that speaks to inclusiveness, cooperation and altruism. It speaks of China, as an environmental leader, despite being the planet’s worst polluter; as a champion of free trade and investment, despite wreathing its economy in protectionist red tape; as a good guy, despite acting as an authoritarian state that is a serial violator of human rights.
 
 In Khorgos, this is no desert mirage, but a reality of steel and concrete, diesel fumes, and plastic sheeting.
 
 “The next step is to diversify our capabilities: information, logistics, financial and an airport,” says the official Guo. “And also tourism.”
 
 Big dreams for a small city that has its sights set on both East and West.

 Xi told a meeting in Beijing that more than 100 countries and international organizations have so far signed up to OBOR, which is touted as a revival of the iconic land and maritime Silk Road via a trade-and-infrastructure network spanning East Asia to Western Europe and south through Africa.
 
 “The progress and results of the Belt and Road Initiative have been greater than expected,” China’s state newswire Xinhua quoted Xi as saying. The Chinese President has traveled extensively over Central Asia and Eastern Europe in recent months to champion the benefits of OBOR.
 
 However, that message has been tricky to sell. OBOR covers over half of the global population, three-quarters of its energy resources and 40% of GDP, yet, crucially, geoeconomic fundamentals have shifted since its unveiling in 2013. Infrastructure routes through resource-rich central Asia were proposed at a time when raw commodity prices were high, but given today’s historic lows, the economic viability of such projects has suffered. Plus there is the added problem of China’s own economic plateau.

 “The unbalanced economic development of countries along ‘One Belt, One Road’ is the main challenge,” says Xu Fengxian, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. “These countries are opening to different degrees, and have different import-export trade and political situations.”
 
 Compounding matters, these once freely navigable trade routes, trodden since the expeditions of Marco Polo in the 13th century, are now slashed by festering conflicts — most notably in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burma (officially now Myanmar), Ukraine and large swaths of the Middle East. China’s own westernmost region of Xinjiang is also prone to outbreaks of strife.
 
 “How China and Pakistan set about securitizing the China-Pakistan economic corridor will in particular be a litmus test for the viability of the Belt and Road Initiative,” says Alexander Neill, Shangri-La Dialogue senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore.
 
 Despite these challenges, Xi’s propaganda train hasn’t slowed. Every day Chinese newspapers teem with dozens of articles exalting the myriad benefits of OBOR. Academics frequently cite OBOR on research proposals, cognizant that any association will radically boost their chances of approval. The OBOR official website is on a recruitment drive ahead of its launch in October.

 However, it is overseas where marketing OBOR needs to be improved. There has been a perception that OBOR is simply about China throwing cash around the region. However, “it’s actually supposed to be an inclusive project and Beijing wants international investors to get involved,” says Neill. “It’s not just about countries sitting back and waiting for China to arrive with investment plans and loans.”
 
 Geopolitically, OBOR is seen as a rival to the Washington-led Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade pact, which Beijing has opted not to join. And one of the principle benefits of OBOR is conflict avoidance with U.S. interests, given the Obama Administration’s “rebalancing” to Asia.
 
 Yet convincing China’s neighbors of the benefits has proved problematic. Although Russia — nearing international pariah status since its annexation of the Crimea — recently inked a $6.2 billion high-speed rail deal, many countries remaining wary. In March, the Thai government shunned proposed Chinese financing for a $15 billion railway project and opted to pay for a less ambitious rail network itself. A similar $5.1 billion joint venture with state-run Indonesian enterprises has suffered from technical problems and mounting costs, reports the Jakarta Post.
 
 “It’s fizzled a bit and hasn’t lifted off as they would have hoped, and a lot of that is to do with the message they are delivering abroad,” said Neill. “Some target countries felt a bit like deer in headlamps.”
 
 Beijing’s overlapping disputes in the South and East China Seas may also be galvanizing suspicions that OBOR is a Trojan horse for extending its geopolitical clout, and dumping excess capacity abroad as its economy flags. As such, peacefully resolving these territorial quarrels and building political capital will take on new impetus for the Xi administration. Beijing has already launched a charm offensive with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
 
 “Disputes in the South China Sea jeopardize the regional shipping and resource development,” adds Xu. “The problem should be solved among the countries near South China Sea. We need to reach a consensus on this issue.”

165,Time,https://time.com/5578514/china-xi-jinping-belt-road-corruption-debt/,0,,USA,W,2019-04-25 00:00:00,Xi Jinping Defends China's Belt and Road Project,"(Bloomberg) — Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to clean up his signature Belt and Road infrastructure program amid criticism the policy is indebting poorer nations and making them dependent on Beijing.“We need to maintain that all cooperation is conducted under the sun and work together to combat corruption with zero tolerance,” Xi said in an address to the annual Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing on Friday.
 
 He vowed that China will negotiate and sign high-standard free trade agreements with more countries, strengthen cooperation in customs, taxation, auditing and supervision, and establish a cooperation mechanism for jointly building the Belt and Road tax collection and management system.
 
 “We need to pursue high-standard cooperation,” he said. “We will adopt widely-accepted rules and standards, and encourage participating companies to follow general international rules and standards in product development, operations procurement, tendering and bidding.”
 
 Some 5,000 attendees from across the globe were in the audience for Xi’s address. Chinese officials have already pledged this week to improve funding arrangements for projects along the Belt and Road network, in response to increasing wariness that the initiative saddles developing countries with loans they can’t repay.
 
 Xi unveiled the plan to rebuild ancient trading routes across Eurasia in 2013, calling it the “project of the century.” China’s government has since poured billions into investments from Africa to the South Pacific. The president champions it as a means to spur development, goodwill and economic integration.
 
 At least seven countries that have agreed to Belt and Road projects have suspended, scaled back or terminated them, or experienced backlash for their involvement in the program. Earlier this month, China struck a deal with Malaysia to resume the East Coast Rail Link project for 44 billion ringgit ($10.7 billion) — down from 65.5 billion ringgit — after deciding to terminate it in January as the Southeast Asian country struggles to narrow its budget deficit.
 
 To address some of the concerns, Beijing is taking a range of steps to exert more control over the program, officials and participants said. They include a more muted publicity drive, clearer rules for state-owned enterprises, restricted use of the Belt and Road brand, and building overseas auditing and anti-corruption mechanisms, according to officials and participants who have spoken to Bloomberg.
 
 The People’s Bank of China will “build an open, market-oriented financing and investment system,” Governor Yi Gang said in brief remarks on Thursday. The government also released its analysis framework for debt sustainability.
 
 Even before the forum officially kicked off, Xi pledged new development with the Philippines in a Thursday meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte, including China’s commitment to build an industrial park north of Manila and provide resources for Duterte’s initiatives to spread wealth to his country’s far-flung regions, presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said.
 
 In March, a senior official from China’s top economic planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission, said China wants to combine its manufacturing and construction know-how with the advanced technology of Western firms on the global trade-and-infrastructure program, pledging greater cooperation with American and European companies on Belt and Road ventures.

 A clip posted to YouTube by the state-run China Daily Wednesday features children, supposedly from countries involved in the project, singing “out their gratitude.” Their song’s lyrics tout how the trade initiative is also a “culture exchange” that allows people to “trade in our wealth” and “connect with our hearts.”
 
 “The future’s coming now, the Belt and Road is how; we’ll share the goodness now, the Belt and Road is how,” goes the refrain.
 
 Appearing as well are ongoing installments of “Belt and Road Bedtime Stories,” in which a father-daughter pair, supposedly from the U.S. but living in Beijing, implausibly discuss the positives of OBOR and globalization before bedtime.
 
 The stories have a timely peg: the father is supposedly leaving on a business trip to Beijing for an upcoming forum on OBOR, hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping. He then launches into an exhilarating tale, in nightly parts, touting Beijing’s vision of China-driven Eurasian trade and economic cooperation.
 
 First unveiled by Xi in 2013, the “belt” and “road” refer respectively to the ancient Silk Road and maritime trade routes across the Eurasian continent and to Africa, which have historically connected China and Europe.
 
 “Once upon a time, several routes led from China to Central Asia and Europe,” begins the story — the father even uses toy camels and boats tracing ancient trade routes on a map.
 
 “A few years ago, China’s president Xi Jinping proposed making new routes like the old routes,” he earnestly continues, as the daughter appears to listen attentively. “This forum is a chance to tell the world about the Belt and Road, like I’m telling you.”
 
 Beijing has been spending lavishly to build a series of roads, railways, ports and pipelines in countries along the routes. It envisions a network of infrastructure that will eventually connect 65 countries across three continents, with over 4 billion people and 40% of the world’s GDP.
 
 The father also take shots at the apparent U.S. retreat from open trade, naming it as a non-participant of the initiative. “Is that because it’s too far away?” the daughter asks.
 
 “Actually, any country can join, anywhere,” answers the father. Burnishing Beijing’s newfound free trade cred, he continues: “[OBOR] is China’s idea, but it belongs to the world.”
 
 In the video’s thumbnail, a storybook’s back cover helpfully reiterates the message.
 
 Online clips —both geared for external and domestic consumption — has become a popular means for China to promote its policies and its perspective on issues, as part of its still fledgling, and often ham-fisted, soft power. Previous attempts have included aggressively nationalistic rap and cute, catchy tunes about its five-year plan.
 
 The country has moved into more traditional mediums to get its message across as well, from television specials on Xi’s anti-graft efforts, featuring confessions by allegedly corrupt officials, to a House of Cards-esque series on day-to-day corruption busting.

 Oliver wanted to focus on China, not because Donald Trump has targeted the country in many speeches, but because of leader Xi Jinping’s consolidation of power. Over the last 30 years China’s GDP has grown by 10% a year, according to Oliver, helping the population climb out of poverty and creating a sense of optimism about the future — which, as a Brit, Oliver finds incomprehensible. “If you look up optimism in the O.E.D.,” Oliver said, “The definition simply reads: No.”
 
 The Chinese parliament recently did away with presidential term limits by a vote of 3,000 to two, which per Oliver, meant two members of parliament were going to have to send Xi an Edible Arrangement to smooth things over with the man who is now “emperor for life.” Oliver said that Xi has slowly been establishing a cult of personality and cultivating a ”man of the people” image, thanks in part to a “bizarre theme park.” (Oliver noted, however, that the U.S. is no better with its theme parks filled with “vomit-inducing teacups” and “massive pantsless sailor ducks.”)
 
 As China grows, Xi has spearheaded two massive projects. One is the so-called Belt and Road initiative, an ambitious infrastructure project that could reshape global trade. The second is a massive crackdown on corruption within the communist party, which has included sweeping up his political rivals. Xi is also cracking down on dissent, censoring internet, putting together a list of “untrustworthy people,“ and even banning references to Winnie the Pooh, because, according to Oliver, he bears a resemblance to the animated bear. He has also introduced a Black Mirror-esque social credit scoring system that rates citizens based on their behavior, and has intensified government suppression of certain religions, artistic expression, minorities and critics.
 
 “China knows that no matter how badly they behave the world will still want to do business with them, like Facebook,” he said. According to Oliver, Trump is leaving a leadership vacuum on the world stage when it comes to China, so Oliver is stepping into the spotlight with a little song to help remind the world what Xi is really about.

168,Time,https://time.com/5714267/china-green-energy/,1,,USA,W,2019-11-01 00:00:00,China Is Bankrolling Green Energy Projects Around the World,"Perched on the ochre scrub of Argentina’s sunbaked Puna Jujeña plateau, the $400 million Cauchari power station is the world’s highest-altitude solar farm at 13,000 ft (about 4,000 meters) above sea level. In Kenya’s volcano-strewn Rift Valley, a newly green-lit, super-efficient electrical substation will soon funnel clean power from the nearby Olkaria Geothermal Plant about 50 miles (80 km) to downtown Nairobi. Some 14 miles off blustery northeastern Scotland, Moray East is set to become the world’s largest offshore wind farm, helping to heat and light up to a million homes.
 
 Three distinct renewable energy projects utilizing cutting edge technology in far-flung corners of the globe sharing one uniting characteristic: Chinese finance. Over the past five years, Chinese bankrolling of green energy projects overseas has soared as the world’s number two economy and number one polluter rebrands itself as an environmental champion.
 
 Not only is China today the world’s largest producer of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles, but it has also been the top investor in clean energy for nine out of the last ten years, according to the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. Since 2014, Chinese equity investment has supported a total of 12,622 megawatts (MW) of wind and solar projects in South and Southeast Asia alone, according to new research by Greenpeace. That’s the equivalent of 21 standard coal plants or enough to power New York City. The shift from simply exporting to bankrolling green tech—driven by both a drying up of domestic subsidies in China and new incentives to invest abroad—is a boon since “it means China really cares about the future profitability of each project,” says Greenpeace campaigner Liu Junyan.
 
 Beijing’s refocus from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a net positive for a myriad of reasons: protecting scarce resources, cutting carbon emissions that spur global warming, and boosting energy security by reducing reliance on costly fuel imports. While only a hatful of nations boast significant oil and gas reserves, nearly all have the potential to develop clean energy themselves, whether via solar, wind, tidal, geothermal or hydroelectric plants, mitigating geopolitical tensions by making the world less dependent on restive regions like the Middle East.

 Chinese export of renewable energy technology around the globe is set to boost Beijing’s clout as the influence of major oil exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia wanes. China has by far the most renewable energy patents with the U.S., Japan and Europe lagging behind. “No country has put itself in a better position to become the world’s renewable energy superpower than China,” says a recent report by the Global Commission on the Geopolitics of Energy Transformation, chaired by former Iceland President Olafur Grimsson.
 
 The U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords under President Donald Trump provided China an opening to seize. America’s abandonment of global leadership on the issue was thrown into sharper focus by Trump’s empty chair during a climate change discussion at August’s G7 meeting in France. “The U.S. administration is not particularly interested in renewables at home let alone overseas,” says Simon Nicholas, an analyst for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Now, China has firmly established its leading position in renewable energy output, as well as in related technologies such as electric vehicles, transmission lines and battery storage, and Beijing is managing to weaponize green technology in a way that strategic rivals like the U.S. may struggle to counter.
 
 For many Chinese investors, a combination of rising domestic competition and rolling back of subsidies at home has widened their gaze. In solar firm Sungrow’s six-story, steel-and-glass headquarters in China’s eastern province of Anhui, CEO Cao Renxian explains how “struggles with the U.S. trade war” forced him to relocate production to India in order to dodge the 25% tariffs the Trump Administration slapped on imported made-in-China panels last year.
 
 After overcoming the significant cultural, legal and linguistic barriers to secure a foothold abroad, Cao now has designs on growing his foreign portfolio. Sungrow currently has stakes in two solar farms of a combined 90 MW in Vietnam, and is constructing a new 60 MW solar farm to soak up the cerulean skies 100 miles north of Melbourne, Australia. Cao explains his global efforts as something of a rapturous calling “to boost environmental protection for our nation and the whole world,” while adding that his firm now sees annual revenues of 10 billion RMB ($1.4 billion).
 
 The geostrategic corollaries are vast. These green investments chime with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a metaphorical repaving of the ancient Silk Road though a $1 trillion transcontinental trade-and-infrastructure network largely bankrolled by Beijing. It has the potential to be the world’s greatest building project since the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe in the aftermath of World War II. The BRI will extend China’s presence across the globe while reorienting nations away from the U.S.-and-Eurocentricism of the last half century.
 
 Since the BRI was enshrined in the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) constitution in 2017, the nation’s biggest banks are obliged to offer preferential loans towards its projects. There are also tens of billions of dollars set aside in dedicated cash pools like the Silk Road Fund. The Import-Export Bank of China, for one, loaned enough money to fund 85% of the Cauchari solar farm in Argentina at just 3% annual interest over 15 years, according to Reuters. (That compares favorably to the more typical 4.5%-7% interest bank loans for such projects.) The proviso is that three quarters of materials used on the project are sourced from Chinese firms such as Huawei.
 
 Apart from the obvious headache of having allies and partners in hock to Beijing, national security concerns loom large. The Trump Administration has accused Huawei—the world’s biggest supplier of telecoms equipment as well as solar inverters, which turn the energy produced by solar panels into a grid-ready electrical current—of installing illicit “backdoors” in equipment that could be used to spy on or cripple users’ networks, and has threatened to cut off intelligence sharing with nations that embed it. (Huawei vehemently denies this, and hard evidence is scant.)
 
 Suspicions regarding Chinese firms persist, however, with the E.U. in March even branding Beijing a “systemic rival.” Last year, Germany blocked a deal in which China’s state-owned State Grid, the world’s largest utility company, would have purchased a $1.2 billion stake in Germany’s national high-voltage energy network, on apparent “national security” grounds.
 
 However, since State Grid’s cutting-edge high-voltage transmission lines, which are far more efficient than existing technology for long-distance transmission, are seen as vital for linking remote and underutilized renewable energy plants into the national grid, many nations believe the benefits outweigh any risk.
 
 Few have embraced Chinese renewable technology and investment as warmly as Brazil, where State Grid is the largest power generation and distribution company. Another Chinese behemoth, China Three Gorges (CTG), the world’s largest hydropower provider with operations across 47 countries, controlling 14 out of a total of 48 hydro-plants in Brazil, amounting to 8% of the nation’s total hydropower capacity, as well as 11 wind farms. CTG Brazil CEO Li Yinsheng tells TIME that Brazil is attractive for investment because it has the resources, demand and necessary regulatory framework. “And by combining [Chinese and Brazilian] equities we are in a unique position to be more competitive in the market,” he says.
 
 It’s not all blue skies ahead for China. The country still generates 70% of its power from coal, and will continue to consume about half the world’s coal until 2023, according to the International Energy Agency. It also approved 141 million tons of new annual coal mining capacity in the first half of this year; in the whole of 2018, Beijing approved just 25 million tons of new coal mining capacity.
 
 The vast majority of the more than $244 billion that China has spent on energy projects worldwide since 2000 have been on fossil fuels, according to data from the Global Development Policy Center, a policy-oriented research body affiliated with Boston University. Despite Xi telling journalists at April’s second Belt and Road Forum in Beijing that he embraces “open, clean and green development,” China has financed more than 300 foreign coal plants from Egypt to the Philippines.
 
 According to Nicholas, the analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, Beijing’s vociferous championing of renewables is “partly an attempt to position itself globally regarding climate issues, but also to distract from the fact that it’s also heavily pushing coal-fired technology to developing countries.” For as long as the Chinese Communist Party’s legitimacy relies on the prosperity of the Chinese people, green intentions will always be sacrificed on the altar of economic expediency, both at home and abroad.

Three major projects illustrate its ambitions and challenges:
 
 CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR
 
 The $46 billion road, rail and energy project will span 2,000 miles between China’s westernmost city of Kashgar and Pakistan’s Gwadar Port, cutting the transport time from 12 days to 36 hours. However, India fiercely opposes the route through disputed Kashmir.
 
 KHORGOS RAIL TERMINAL
 
 This $250 million dry port on the China-Kazakhstan border will open up untapped Central Asian markets, though the rail project is twice the cost of sea freight and only marginally faster.
 
 LAMU PORT
 
 The first phase of this $480 million deep-sea port in Kenya, a transport hub for a road, rail and pipeline network across Central Africa, is due to open next year. But low commodity prices threaten its economic viability.

170,Time,https://time.com/5720756/china-trade-trump-win-southeast-asia/,0,,USA,W,2019-11-07 00:00:00,How Trump Gave China a Win on Trade in Southeast Asia,"Yet another major trade deal is on the cusp of being completed, and no one deserves more credit for that than President Donald Trump… whether he likes it or not.
 
 On Nov. 4, it was announced that the 10 countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will join with Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea and China to sign a new free-trade agreement called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). China took a major interest in RCEP after Washington began championing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal in 2013. Under President Barack Obama, TPP was envisioned as a way of reining in China’s ambitions by offering Asian countries an economic alternative to signing up with Beijing. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the trade pact just three days into office. The rest of the remaining signatories went ahead and signed the deal, but without the U.S. on board, TPP lost much of its weight.
 
 If the Belt and Road Initiative–a Beijing-funded series of infrastructure projects throughout Asia and Europe–is the hardware of China’s ambitious global plan, RCEP is the software much of it is supposed to run on. But compared with TPP, RCEP is much less demanding of its signatories, opting to bypass environment, technology and labor standards as part of the deal, and has fewer regulatory requirements of its members. It also provides less market access to those that have signed up.
 
 Over the short term, these omissions will limit the economic boost RCEP provides its member states, but more economic gains will be realized over the long term, reducing most tariffs between members as well as many of the trade barriers that currently exist. It will also go a long way toward strengthening regional supply chains among the participating countries.
 
 It wasn’t easy getting to this point. Plenty of countries were hesitant about stronger alignment with Beijing, even if there were economic gains to be made. In a last-minute twist, India opted out of the deal, fearing that it would be inundated by Chinese imports that would hurt it over the long run and explode its deficit with China. Beijing had offered to address these concerns with longer time frames for phasing out tariffs, but New Delhi hoped to extract even more concessions before it dropped out. Member states like Australia maintain that India is welcome to rejoin at any time (which is certainly understandable from their perspective–adding another billion-plus consumer market to the trade pact could prove a critical counterweight to Chinese influence going forward). But the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, the former’s lurch toward protectionist trade policy more broadly, and recent data suggesting the global economy is headed for a slowdown all provided the momentum needed for the remaining players to get the deal over the finish line.
 
 This is a major geopolitical victory for China and helps further Beijing’s argument that in 2019, China is the one defending globalization instead of taking advantage of it. It could also help China accelerate its ongoing trade talks with Japan and South Korea, which have struggled to overcome historical animosity and mistrust.
 
 Overall, though, this is a worrying hit to global trade, threatening to fracture a global economy already coming apart at the seams. Asia, and foreign companies in Asia, will now have to grapple with two multilateral trade agreements that boast different standards and include different members. And the biggest loser of all is the U.S., which is now letting China and others define new rules of trade while it just sits on the sidelines.

Looks to China to Shield Itself From the Fallout of Trump’s Trade War,"When asked by CBS News on July 15 to name America’s greatest foe, the first name past the lips of President Trump was the European Union, given “what they do to us in trade,” followed by Russia and then China. By launching steep tariffs on a swath of Chinese and E.U. imports, Trump has given Beijing and Brussels unprecedented incentive to work together–as we saw at the unusually sunny E.U.-China summit on July 16. Unfortunately for China, it’s going to take more than Trump to push Europe wholeheartedly into China’s trade embrace.
 
 The China part of the equation is easy. The E.U. is already China’s biggest trading partner and its second-largest export market. Chinese foreign direct investment into Europe hit $12 billion in the first half of 2018, while Chinese investment into the U.S. fell 92% over the same period, to just $2 billion.
 
 And so where last year’s summit failed to produce even a joint statement, this year both China and the E.U. agreed to deepen their partnership–and even threw in a separate addendum on climate issues for good measure. Previously, the relationship had been chilled by European fears about China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a series of infrastructure projects around the world intended to boost both trade and political influence globally. China’s highly leveraged infrastructure loans have left certain countries in Asia and Africa heavily indebted to Beijing, something the E.U. wants to avoid in the smaller economies of Central and Eastern Europe. But the Chinese have now seemingly agreed to play by the E.U.’s rules and standards.
 
 And Trump’s continued blasting of Beijing over its trade practices, for the ostensible benefit of U.S. producers, spells a huge opportunity for the Europeans.
 
 Take the automotive sector, for example. China has pledged to remove foreign-ownership caps in the auto sector by 2022, and even earlier for electric and other new-energy vehicles. But it will withhold many of the opportunities to U.S. firms so long as Trump continues his tariff strategy, leaving European automakers to reap the rewards. It’s a good reminder to Trump that trade wars often have unintended consequences–especially when they are being fought on multiple fronts.
 
 But the E.U.’s shift still looks more like a tactical move than a wholesale change of strategy. One day after the China summit, the bloc completed its largest trade deal ever, with Japan–an agreement that makes far more sense for Brussels. It is easier for Europeans to cast their lot with a liberal democracy that wants to preserve the current global system than with a state-capitalist government looking to fundamentally change that system to fit its own needs. And Brussels is quietly making its own efforts to restrict Chinese investment in sensitive sectors, just as Washington has cracked down on Beijing’s efforts to acquire intellectual property in cutting-edge fields.
 
 For the time being, this is a relationship of mutual convenience. Brussels is clearly attuned to the fact that the Chinese leadership’s approach to trade is extremely opportunistic–and no doubt will closely monitor investments in eastern and southern Europe to ensure that China isn’t laying debt traps for the E.U.’s smaller members. But for now, Trump’s pre-eminent “foe” is making plans to weather the trade war–while counting down the days until the 2020 presidential election.

 China has made its decision. Beijing is building a separate system of Chinese technology—its own standards, infrastructure, and supply chains—to compete with the West.
 
 Make no mistake: this is the single most consequential geopolitical decision taken in the last three decades. It’s also the greatest threat to globalization since the end of World War II.
 
 It wasn’t supposed to be like this.
 
 Globalization has lifted billions of people from poverty around the world. We now live longer, healthier, and more productive lives than ever before. We are better educated and better informed than at any time in history. There has never been a better place and a better time to be alive than right here, right now.
 
 So why are so many people so angry, and why is globalization under unprecedented threat?
 
 Why are citizens in country after country bitterly casting aside both governing and opposition parties in favor of political disruptors?
 
 At this moment in history, why is there so much alarm?
 
 Because this IS a moment of transformation, and uncertainty. In much of the world, the lightning-fast, cross-border flows of ideas, information, people, money, goods and services—the same forces that have created so much opportunity and prosperity—also generate fear.
 
 Fear that the world now becomes more complicated and more dangerous in real time. Fear that the world we knew is gone for good, and fear that no one is willing and able to do anything about it.
 
 I want to talk with you today about why all this is happening, and why it’s so vitally important that we’re having this conversation at this moment—and in the heart of this great country.
 
 Japan is both blessed and burdened by its unique place in this G-Zero world. Japan has the political stability, the foresight, and the technological talent to help lead the world into a brighter future than the one we currently face. We all have reason to hope that Japan’s leaders, its companies, its political will, and its people will help lead the transition toward a new order, one in which human ingenuity, moral imagination, and courage can help all of us meet the challenges to come.
 
 The Geopolitical Recession
 
 When I started Eurasia Group in 1998, our clients were interested almost exclusively in the so-called emerging-markets countries, those that presented both big growth opportunities and unfamiliar political challenges.
 
 I defined an emerging market as “any country where politics matters at least as much as economic fundamentals for market outcomes.” Countries like Japan, the United States, Canada, and the leading nations of Western Europe offered a much more stable and predictable political landscape, but more modest opportunities for growth.
 
 Those days are gone. The financial crisis of 2008 and the turmoil that followed have brought politics directly into the performance of economies and markets in even the world’s richest countries.
 
 We also face a growing number of transnational threats. The U.S.-led global order is finished. So many of the dark clouds now hanging over us—from climate change to cyber-conflict, from terrorism to the post-industrial revolution—move unchecked across borders, leaving national governments much less able to meet the needs of their citizens.
 
 Today, it is not economics but geopolitics that has become the main driver of global economic uncertainty. The world has entered a “geopolitical recession,” a bust cycle for the international system and relations among governments. It’s a time when alliances, institutions, and the values that bind them together are all coming apart.
 
 From an historical perspective, geopolitical recessions are both rarer than economic recessions and longer-lasting. We’ll be living in this geopolitical recession for at least a decade to come.
 
 *****
 
 How did we get here?
 
 Economists tell us that the process of “creative destruction” fuels the engine of growth that builds the future, and history says that’s true. But lives and livelihoods are destroyed in the process, and growing numbers of people say their government is either powerless to help them manage or doesn’t care what happens to them. Resentment of elites is on the rise in every region of the world. The system is rigged against them, they believe; it’s increasingly hard to argue they’re wrong.
 
 This creates opportunities for a new breed of populist who offers scapegoats and promises of protection. These politicians did not invent this problem. They’re just profiting from it.
 
 And the greatest worry is this: All this anger is building in good economic times. What happens when economies start to slow?
 
 History shows that governments that are unpopular at home are more likely to make trouble abroad, especially with their neighbors, to rally public support and divert attention from domestic troubles. That breeds less trust among governments. The risk of misunderstanding rises. Accidents are more likely—and more likely to escalate toward conflict.
 
 There are three implications to consider…
 
 The first centers on “tail risks,” the low-likelihood-but-high-impact events that have become commonplace in a world reshaped by China’s rise, Middle East turmoil, populist Europe, revanchist Russia, divided America, a world-record 71 million displaced people, and the destabilizing effects of technological and climate changes.
 
 Imagine a military accident in the South China Sea, at a time when the U.S. and Chinese presidents are locked in a war of wills over trade and technology, and determined to project strength at home, that spirals out of control.
 
 Turn to the Middle East—the U.S. has confronted Iran. Since President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal and then re-imposed sanctions, Iran has taken bold military action—including a strike on the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure. Washington responded by sending troops to Saudi Arabia, a move which, you might recall, sharply increased the risk of terrorism in the U.S. a generation ago.
 
 What if President Trump is defeated for re-election next year, and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un discovers the next U.S. president won’t accept his phone calls? What provocative action might he take? What accidents might he risk?
 
 What if a debt crisis hits Italy, created when a future Italian government defies EU budget rules and inadvertently creates a financial crisis too large for lenders to manage? Or a miscalculation in Ukraine pulls Russia into a shooting war? Or a US-Russia cyber confrontation hits critical infrastructure, creating a humanitarian crisis inside an American city?
 
 The lack of coordinated leadership in today’s world, our G-zero world, makes all of these crises both more likely to happen and more difficult to manage when they do. Individually, they are long-shots. Collectively, they pose unprecedented danger.
 
 The second implication of the geopolitical recession is the breakdown of international institutions.
 
 The tens of millions of displaced people around the world today create one of the most urgent and expensive problems that the United Nations has to cope with. Yet, even as national governments are less willing to welcome big numbers of refugees, even fewer are willing to invest more to support the UN Refugee Agency.
 
 We also see fragmentation of European institutions as voters send growing numbers of anti-EU politicians to serve in the European parliament. There is no longer consensus among Europeans on the free movement of EU citizens across borders, on how to manage immigrants from outside the EU, or on important questions like how best to manage relations with Russia.
 
 The Trump administration has threatened the coherence of NATO, the most successful military alliance in history (French President Macron certainly seems to agree), and has withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty with Russia, the UN Human Rights Council, and the Paris Climate Accord, to name only a few.
 
 The inevitable consequence of all this is a world that has become more unpredictable and much less safe.
 
 There is little chance in this environment to establish new agreements and new institutions to help manage tomorrow’s crises.
 
 Instead, individual governments will adopt their own rules in an attempt to contain challenges that don’t respect borders. They will threaten economic penalties and military retaliation in a world with fewer institutions able to enforce generally accepted rules and practices.
 
 The last implication of the geopolitical recession: The weakness of today’s international system not only leaves the world more vulnerable to crisis, but less resilient when crisis comes. In recent years, we’ve avoided a major international crisis. We’ve seen Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, the growth of populism across Europe, Russia’s bid to undermine Ukraine’s independence, Xi Jinping’s consolidation of power in China, a meltdown in Venezuela, and plenty of individual fires in the Middle East and in democracies across the world. But we have not yet experienced anything during this period that poses a challenge to the entire international system, and the global economy has remained relatively strong.
 
 Our luck can’t last.
 
 There is one superpower in today’s world, one country that can project political, economic, and military power into every region. That superpower is still the United States.
 
 That’s why it matters so much that Americans themselves no longer agree on what role their country should play in the world. Everywhere I travel, including here in Japan, I hear questions and concerns about President Donald Trump. As if he is the source of all this confusion. As if his departure from the political stage, either next year or in five, would set America and the world on a path back toward some idea of normal.
 
 That’s not going to happen, because Donald Trump is a symptom, not a source, of this anxiety and confusion. Yes, it is Trump who questions the value of NATO and whether US troops should be stationed abroad. Trump is the one who suggests Japan and South Korea should develop nuclear weapons of their own to relieve burdens on the United States, the one who has declared a trade war on China, while threatening Europe, Japan, Mexico, and even Canada.
 
 Honestly, who threatens Canada?
 
 But step back a dozen years and think about why Barack Obama was elected president. After eight years of George W. Bush’s war on terror, it was Obama who promised to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan—and not to start new ones. Other Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, were tainted in the minds of many Americans by their support for the war on Saddam Hussein.
 
 Step back further. In 1992, Bill Clinton promised that the end of the Cold War meant the end of Cold War burdens. He promised a “peace dividend,” money no longer needed to defeat the Soviets that could instead be invested in strengthening America at home.
 
 Americans don’t want to run the world. They haven’t for a long time.
 
 And with each passing year, there are fewer Americans old enough to remember the Cold War, to say nothing of World War II. In fact, there are now American soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan who were not yet born on September 11, 2001.
 
 The reluctance of the United States as a superpower creates a global vacuum of leadership. But no one is stepping up to take that role in the way that, more than a century ago, America emerged just as the sun began to set on the British Empire.
 
 Europe remains profoundly preoccupied, particularly over economic issues dividing north and south and political issues dividing east and west. And while President Xi Jinping has declared a new era for China in the world, China’s leadership remains fundamentally cautious when it comes to accepting heavy international burdens.
 
 That’s why, when it comes to international leadership, Beijing will not soon become any more reliable a provider of public goods than Washington.
 
 And why a future crisis will be so hard to manage.
 
 Fallout for globalization
 
 Then there is the impact of geopolitical recession on globalization itself.
 
 Globalization has changed our understanding of how things are made and how we might live. Around the world, we celebrate our national holidays with fireworks made in China. The customer service calls we make to fix our computers are answered in India. Our cars are made from parts that come from dozens of countries. We are all globally integrated. It is no longer meaningful to say where our products are produced.
 
 And, until recently, politics hasn’t played a big part in these processes. That’s no longer true.
 
 There is no longer a global free market. China, soon to be the world’s largest economy, practices state capitalism, a system that allows government officials to ensure that economic growth ultimately serves political and national interests.
 
 China’s state capitalist system distorts the traditional workings of a market-driven economy by relying heavily on state-owned enterprises and state-backed national champions to ensure economic—and therefore political—stability. It depends on state subsidies that allow political officials to direct enormous amounts of capital and other resources as they choose. The government picks winners and losers.
 
 The success of this system for China and the Chinese Communist Party is undeniable. The good news for the rest of us is that Chinese growth has supported global growth. Crucially, the hybrid global economy it has created does not end globalization. Both free market and state capitalist systems still enable goods and capital to move around the world.
 
 But the future of globalization is not so simple. Different parts of the global economy are adapting to the end of the US-led global order in different ways.
 
 The marketplace for commodities—especially food, metals, and energy—indeed is only becoming more globalized. US and Chinese tariffs dominate the news, for as long as they last, but the bigger story is the expansion of global commodity markets.
 
 New technologies are making energy production more efficient and lowering costs at a faster pace than politics can drive them higher. That’s why, even after a dramatic missile strike earlier this year at the heart of Saudi oil infrastructure knocked half of Saudi oil production offline, the resulting jump in oil prices left them at levels just half of what they were in 2008.
 
 With more than a billion people entering a global middle class over the past two generations, and the pace of that growth increasing, the globalization of the commodities market will continue.
 
 The market for goods and services, on the other hand, will become less global. That’s in part because the role of labor in production is shrinking dramatically as new technologies bring automation and machine learning into the workplace. Manufacturers want to produce where production is least expensive. That won’t change. What has changed is the search for cheap labor, because the rise of middle classes in China, India, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa has increased wages everywhere, giving producers good reason to automate production.
 
 Further, the growth in populism we’ve seen in so many countries is driven in part by anger over job losses. That means that political officials are more likely to build barriers designed to protect local jobs than to restrict the flow of trade.
 
 These trends will shorten global supply chains for goods and services as each country or company works to reduce its vulnerability to disruption in countries involved in trade disputes. It won’t happen immediately, because CEOs don’t want to make difficult decisions until they believe they have to. But as the global economy tightens, those executives will increasingly produce goods and services where the customers are.
 
 Finally, there is the global market for data and information. This market is breaking in two. It is no longer global. In the beginning, the internet—the Worldwide Web—was driven by a single set of standards and rules. With very few exceptions, one consumer had virtually the same access as another. No longer.
 
 Today, China and the United States are building two distinct online ecosystems. That’s true for the transformation of today’s internet, but also for the construction of the new internet of things. The American tech ecosystem, with all its strengths and shortcomings, is built by the private sector and (loosely) regulated by the government. The Chinese system is dominated by the state. That’s also true for big data collection, for development of artificial intelligence, for the rollout of 5G cellular network technology, and for defense and retaliation against cyberattacks.
 
 This leaves us with a big question: Where exactly will the new Berlin Wall stand? Where will we find the boundary between one technological system and the other? Will Europe align with the United States? Or will the EU fragment into individual decisions within individual European countries? How will India position itself? And South Korea? And Brazil? What pressures will even Japan face?
 
 There is another fundamental question: Will the US-led data and information model continue to be driven by the private sector? Or will future fears for national security allow for the creation of a “tech-based military industrial complex” in the US?
 
 The answers to these questions carry profound implications. In the markets for commodities, goods, and services, global players are both competitors and (potential) partners. Each player wants more market-share, but everyone benefits from an open trading system that creates opportunities for all. Trade wars may be launched to achieve specific goals, but this isn’t a zero-sum competition. Business as usual promises something for everyone. That’s a critical support for global peace and prosperity.
 
 This is no longer true in the data and information economy. Here, much as in the US-Soviet Cold War, the existence of two competing systems limits commercial opportunities and threatens national security. Each side’s hoped-for outcome is elimination of the other system.
 
 America and China
 
 Which means that we now need to talk about China and the United States.
 
 What should the rest of the world want from China? We should want it to succeed. The world needs China to remain stable, productive, and increasingly prosperous to fuel global growth. We need China to play a constructive international role, even if only a limited one. To work with other governments to meet the challenges posed by poverty, conflict, public health risks, lack of education, lack of infrastructure, climate change, and the advance of disruptive new technologies. And, of course, we need these things from the United States too.
 
 The threat China poses to the US is smaller than many in Washington believe. China has even less interest in going to war with the US than the US has in going to war with China. China is a regional, but not a global, military power. Economic interdependence will continue, despite concerted efforts on both sides to reduce economic vulnerabilities.
 
 The greatest source of US-China conflict comes from technology. Here, China is, today, a true superpower. Here, there is a Cold War structure to the relationship that will affect every region of the world. Here, the US does have an interest in seeing China fail, because China’s technological development poses a foundational challenge to the values on which global stability and prosperity depend.
 
 This is a subject on which America’s Democrats and Republicans agree. Imagine that.
 
 The stakes are real. The idea of a Splinternet, the creation of parallel technology ecosystems, isn’t just a threat to globalization. It’s a competition that those who believe in political freedoms might lose.
 
 What should we do?
 
 Allow me to offer two proposals. The first is the creation of an organization equivalent to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body that’s responsible for objectively assessing the world’s vulnerability and responses to climate change. We need a similar group to establish ground rules for our digital world, the data and artificial intelligence that fuel it, and its future development.
 
 My second proposal is this—the world needs a digital WTO, a World Data Organization. As with the WTO, uniting governments that believe in online openness and transparency in an organization that China will ultimately have an economic and security incentive to want to join, especially if it’s the only way Beijing can secure access to developed markets. Carrots will work better than sticks.
 
 America, Europe, Japan, and like-minded willing-and-able partners must work together to set future standards for artificial intelligence, data, privacy, citizens’ rights, and intellectual property. Develop a permanent secretariat to determine these digital norms together, and a judiciary mechanism to enforce them. The Americans have the innovative capacity and startups. The Europeans are the regulatory superpower. Japan is the principle laboratory for a world that needs to see how AI can improve people’s lives.
 
 That’s how we can address the U.S.-China technology cold war.
 
 There is, however, an area where Chinese cooperation with the West is both critical and entirely feasible right now. To combat the advance of climate change and its worst effects, we need to build a “Green Marshall Plan,” a mainly Western-funded project that includes the best ideas of private sector thinkers and state-funded scientists from the West and China on how best to make the policy changes and invent the technologies to clean the world’s air and water and limit the damage inflicted by climate change.
 
 The so-called “Green New Deal” now under scrutiny in the US presupposes that Americans can solve their own climate problems. They can’t. China is now the world’s #1 carbon-emitter, by a wide margin, and China shares an interest with the rest of the world in fighting climate change. It isn’t just New York and Tokyo that face the coming storms and rising seas. It’s Shanghai too.
 
 Japan’s Global Role
 
 Now it’s time to talk about Japan.
 
 I have believed for a long time that the GZERO Summit must take place in the great city of Tokyo. In the international drama I’ve described, the world needs Japan to play a unique role—a leading role.
 
 In a world where politics is driven by partisan grievance, Japan is today the world’s healthiest advanced industrial democracy. It has the strongest political leadership. Despite the many controversies in Japanese life, this is the one country that has defied the global trend toward polarization.
 
 Japan is the fairest and most equal society among major industrialized nations. Its institutions have greater domestic public legitimacy than any other country. Many years of personal experience have taught me that Japan’s private sector is innovative and dynamic. In a world where governments have repeatedly failed to protect the long-term security and prosperity of their citizens, Japan has a social safety net that works. That has never been more important.
 
 Yes, Japan needs the surge of talent, creativity, and hard work that comes from welcoming far more women into the workforce, including in senior positions. And yes, Japan’s challenge of managing unsustainable public debt continues.
 
 But Japan’s undeniable advantages will help this country offer the world much-needed leadership. Prime Minister Abe’s recent engagement with political and business leaders in India, Germany, Iran, and many governments in Africa show the beginnings of what is possible if Japan seizes the chance to help the world meet the challenges I’ve described today. And because Japan has the opportunity, I believe it has an obligation.
 
 There are five areas where I believe Japanese leadership is most badly needed:
 
 Japan can guide the world toward sustainable economic growth. The cost of “growth at all costs,” has become shamefully obvious. The pollution of our air, water, and soil; the advance of climate change; and the failure of governments to protect the social contract that binds them to citizens make clear that the world needs a model of “sustainable capitalism.” Japan’s quest for Society 5.0, one built atop a foundation of machine learning, robotics, and other innovations for enriching human lives provides opportunities for Japan’s government and industry to show the world a way forward that won’t take us over a cliff. Japan can boost cooperation and limit conflict between China and the United States. These two countries will occupy the center of our future international system, but Japan stands in a unique position to give each side greater incentive to coordinate in areas where their interests coincide and to avoid worst-case confrontations in those where they compete. Japan can bolster multilateral institutions. I believe that Japan should join the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and push to make the institution more central to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, and therefore the Belt and Road’s financing less opaque. This would be good for Japan and Japanese companies—and good for the world. Japan should persuade its American allies to join too. More broadly, Japan should work with Germany, Canada, and other like-minded governments to defend existing international institutions and to participate fully in global rule-making for trade, data transfer, and innovation policies. The leadership that Japan has already demonstrated in making the Trans-Pacific Partnership a reality proves that these things are possible. Japan can continue work on a cyber coordination and monitoring center that can promote and direct investment in Research and Development that was cut during its recession. It can accomplish this in cooperation with the countries that are part of the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance plus Germany. Japan can lead the way in providing and coordinating the distribution of humanitarian aid in a world that badly needs it. As one of the world’s wealthiest countries, Japan has the influence and credibility to coordinate efforts to help people and governments in need. Japan’s industrial sector can offer both leadership and advanced technological solutions to promote sustainable development of global societies, particularly in the areas of healthcare provision, construction of smart cities, and the redesign of the workplace for the 21st
 
 The End of the American Order
 
 As we look toward the future of relations among nations, there is one prediction we can make with certainty: No matter what happens in next year’s U.S. elections, no matter who is president or which party is in power, the American-led international order is finished. It is not coming back.
 
 But it’s just as important to recognize that the aspirations that this order represents for many people remain.
 
 These aspirations, these values, were not invented in the United States. They are not “Western.” They are not simply the product of Europe’s Enlightenment. The drive for liberty, fairness, rule of law, freedom of expression, and the undeniable human drive for openness and exploration are universal.
 
 America can no longer claim to be the primary driving force in defense of these values. Americans have our role to play. So do Europeans. So do the people of Japan. And inside China, Russia, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, inside countries large and small, there are people hungry for the chance to become captains of their fate.
 
 Competition and conflict among nations is inevitable. The warming of the planet and the rise of artificial intelligence will bring existential challenges.
 
 But we live in a G-zero world, a world without leadership that people can trust and count on. It’s up to all of us to fill that void. People in positions of power. People in positions of influence. People in this room right now.

 Chinese President Xi Jinping is traveling to Rome in late March to officially welcome Italy into his ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese-backed plan to unite East and West with railways, ports, tunnels and other infrastructure projects and transform China’s economic strength at home into undisputed geopolitical power abroad.
 
 While China has already made inroads into various Eastern European countries, signing up Italy–the euro zone’s third largest economy and a G-7 member–has pushed concerns about China’s potential to splinter Europe from the periphery to the core, literally and figuratively. On March 12, the E.U.’s executive body published a paper branding China a “systemic rival” and urging stronger oversight of its investments in Europe. Even the White House has telegraphed its concerns, with a spokesperson commenting that there’s “no need for the Italian government to lend legitimacy to China’s infrastructure vanity project.”
 
 But absent an alternative proposed by Washington or the E.U., Italy is set to become the first G-7 country to enroll in China’s signature foreign policy initiative, one that takes square aim at a post–World War II geopolitical order that’s already unraveling.
 
 This is not the first time worries about the relations between specific E.U. countries and foreign powers have raised alarm; Russia has also made overtures to certain European countries. But the European leadership could rely on the fact that the E.U.’s combined economic heft far outweighed whatever meager economic benefits Russia’s submerging economy had to offer. Brussels cannot say the same about Beijing.
 
 The concern in Brussels is exacerbated by the knowledge that U.S. President Donald Trump will soon turn his sights to Europe, once his trade war with Xi reaches a conclusion. European politicians have begun bracing for auto tariffs from Washington, which look poised to hit as the global economy begins slowing down. And the U.S.’s recent threat to withhold intelligence from allies who sign up for 5G equipment from China’s state-championed Huawei signals that Washington will not hesitate to force European allies to choose between Uncle Sam and the Chinese.
 
 That would be a difficult choice even if Chinese investment were being pitted against a transatlantic relationship that was alive, well and supported by common U.S.-E.U. values. In fact, the relationship is on life support. And when China offers carrots while the U.S. offers only sticks, the choice for governments in Europe–especially populist, nonconformist ones like in Rome–is made all the easier. Other G-7 countries will be watching closely to see if there’s any U.S. pushback against Italy.
 
 China, meanwhile, gets to demonstrate yet again that it is capable of driving the global agenda, while providing a type of stability and largesse that its only other genuine geopolitical rival is no longer interested in offering. The Italian government gets to show that it is beholden to neither Brussels nor Washington, burnishing its antiestablishment credentials in the process.
 
 And the U.S. and Europe get to show yet again that the world they knew for the better part of the past century continues to pass them by.

 He will be remembered as the first Chinese President to use a blend of soft and hard power to boost China’s international image and begin its expeditionary ambitions. China’s movement toward center stage has run in parallel with Xi’s personal brand—a modern Son of Heaven recapturing China’s pre-eminence. He has made himself indispensable.
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative, authored by Xi, creates an expansive intercontinental mercantilist network, marking the first time China has “gone global.” He has jettisoned collective leadership for imperial one-man rule and promoted interpretations of Confucian values—benevolence, virtue and filial piety—as the underpinnings of the 21st century Chinese Dream of prosperity. It also conveniently reasserts the Chinese Communist Party back into the affairs of state.
 
 Contradictions are many in the world’s second largest economy, where civil society is nonexistent. Over the past four decades, no other country has benefited as much from the current world order, nor is so desirous of changing it. Xi’s authoritarianism being showcased to the world serves as an alternative to the Western model. His legacy is tied to whether it will be accepted.

 Gwadar Port is part of a corridor that could help ease Pakistan's energy crisis Muhammad Yousuf—AP
 
 On May 14 and 15, Beijing hosted a global summit on China's $900 billion Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to create a trade and infrastructure network spanning the ancient Silk Road through Europe and Africa. Three major projects illustrate its ambitions and challenges:
 
 CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR
 
 The $46 billion road, rail and energy project will span 2,000 miles between China's westernmost city of Kashgar and Pakistan's Gwadar Port, cutting the transport time from 12 days to 36 hours. However, India fiercely opposes the route through disputed Kashmir.
 
 KHORGOS RAIL TERMINAL
 
 This $250 million dry port on the China-Kazakhstan border will open up untapped Central Asian markets, though the rail project is twice the cost of sea freight and only marginally faster.
 
 LAMU PORT
 
 The first phase of this $480 million deep-sea port in Kenya, a transport hub for a road, rail and pipeline network across Central Africa, is due to open next year. But low commodity prices threaten its economic viability.","['port', 'silk', 'open', 'pakistans', 'rail', 'chinas', 'network', 'transport', 'big', 'energy', 'plans', 'million', 'road', 'project']","{'China': 4, 'India': 1, 'Kazakhstan': 1, 'Kenya': 1, 'Pakistan': 4}",,,,,
180,Time,https://time.com/5175215/xi-jinping-china-term-limits/,-0.3,,USA,W,2018-02-26 00:00:00,China: One-Man Rule Under Xi Jinping Should Worry Us All,"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has traditionally rooted the legitimacy of its autocratic rule in the principle of institutionalization: it is the Party, and not a particular person or family, which holds the reins of power for, ostensibly, the benefit of all 1.4 billion Chinese.
 
 But that already specious assertion took a severe knock on Sunday following the publishing of a proposal — one certain to be ratified next month — that China’s two five-year presidential term limit be abolished. This will essentially allow current President Xi Jinping, who is already China’s strongest leader for generations, to remain in power for as long as he desires.
 
 The move is the culmination of a series of power plays by Xi over recent months, including having his eponymous political thought enshrined in the national constitution, and failing to appoint any potential successors to China’s apex executive body, the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC). But the timing of the announcement before Xi has even officially completed his first term in office has stunned China-watchers and raised serious questions concerning the governance of the world’s number two economy going forward.
 
 “This is a very significant move towards China transforming into a one-man system,” says Jude Blanchette, a Beijing-based researcher on Chinese politics for The Conference Board analysis firm. “It’s hard to overemphasize what a big deal this is for the future of China and the world given China’s importance to the global economy and global institutions.”
 
 Xi’s consolidation of power domestically comes as he has also announced his intention to be more assertive internationally. His signature Belt and Road Initiative — a trade and infrastructure network tracing the ancient Silk Road though Eurasia and Africa — stands to radically boost China’s geopolitical clout at a time when the White House under Donald Trump has questioned key alliances and the very international institutions that have been the foundation of American hegemony.

 China’s burgeoning influence, augmented by Washington’s retreat into nativist languor, further normalizes autocratic political systems that have been on the rise since the 2008 financial crisis. Beijing has ramped up censorship and clamped down on dissent since Xi, 64, took power in late 2012, coupled with incessant trolling of Western democracy as unstable, unpredictable and unable to deliver the goods. Meanwhile, Trump has launched a war on the American media and toadied up to strongmen from Russia’s Vladimir Putin to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and, of course, Xi himself.
 
 The question remains whether China is set to repeat past mistakes where unquestioning observance to its leadership contributed to disasters like the Great Leap Forward of the 1950s and Cultural Revolution a decade later. Academics and officials are increasingly reluctant to voice opinions that differ from the Party leadership, which is invariably hailed with gilded paeans in the state press, while critics are summarily detained.
 
 “There’s a risk of it become courtier culture, sycophancy, just telling him what he wants to hear,” says Professor Nick Bisley, an Asia expert at Australia’s La Trobe University. “It doesn’t have to be like that but the risks are very real and unsettling for those inside and outside China.”
 
 Agrees Blanchette: “If we hold that good policy outcomes require the maximum amount of voices and input in design and implementation then we should be worried.”

 Xi should know the risks better than anyone. Like millions of his contemporaries, he was sent down to live in the countryside during the Cultural Revolution of the mid 1960s, reduced to toiling in fields and sleeping in a flea-infested cave in China’s hardscrabble central province of Shaanxi. His father was repeatedly purged by CCP patriarch Mao Zedong, whose unassailable cult of personality wreaked numerous hardships on his people, including the Great Leap Forward, a frenzied experiment in collectivized industrialization that cost some 20-50 million lives between 1958 and 1962.
 
 It was because of these calamities that the CCP leadership from Deng Xiaoping — architect of China’s economic revival — introduced collective leadership around the PSC, presidential term limits to ensure a smooth leadership transition, and thus countering a Mao-like strongman ever holding the country to ransom again. But Xi over recent months has taken careful aim at each of these safeguards. Meanwhile, his trademark ideology of the “Chinese Dream” and “great revival of the Chinese nation” has drawn uneasy comparisons with Mao-era sloganeering.
 
 “While there appears little internal opposition to Xi at present, it could emerge in the future, such as in the event of economic instability or a mishandled international incident,” says Tom Rafferty, regional manager for China at The Economist Intelligence Unit. “Nervousness about his position could lead Xi to back wider crackdowns and political purges.”
 
 The lack of neither elections nor term limits risks such problems returning with a vengeance. And worryingly for the international community, that Xi is brazenly prepared to rewrite four decades of political orthodoxy at home means he would have few qualms about tearing up the rulebook abroad, where Beijing has long flouted international norms that it perceives as constraining its interests.
 
 “It’s another piece of evidence that says be worried about a China led by Xi Jinping,” says Bisley. “Because if he’s happy to do this at home, then boy is he going to be happy to do it abroad.”

181,Time,https://time.com/5440653/vietnam-us-china-balance/,0,,USA,W,2018-10-31 00:00:00,How Vietnam's New Leader Could Strengthen Ties to China,"Nestled in Hanoi’s leafy French Quarter, under the shadow of its neoclassical Opera House, is a tiny gallery that exclusively stocks Vietnamese propaganda art. The interior is piled high with posters—all square jaws, oversize clenched fists and primary colors—supporting the revolutionary hero Ho Chi Minh, who founded the Communist Party and led the resistance to French and American forces during the 1950s and ’60s. Slogans rouse patriots to “Remember Uncle Ho on this victorious day” and “Crush the Yankee imperialists.”
 
 “Today Vietnam has a new President,” says Phan Duk, who opened the gallery five years ago. “But I forget his name.” That’s not unusual. Unlike Ho, Vietnam’s recent leaders have shied from the limelight. For almost half a century, they have jettisoned the cult of personality in favor of ruling from the shadows, with power shared between several top government roles.
 
 That changed on Oct. 23 when Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong also assumed the role of President, after the incumbent died in September. In a televised ceremony, the silver-haired Trong, 74, vowed to be “absolutely loyal to the nation, people and the constitution.” His ascent—-confirmed by 99.8% of lawmakers, with just one token dissenter—makes him the first person to hold both titles since Ho in the 1960s. Of Vietnam’s traditional “four-pillar” top positions designed to diffuse power, Trong, a Hanoi native who became General Secretary in 2011, now holds half.
 
 Trong, a party ideologue, has close ties with communist leaders in China, whose regional influence has grown as its $1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative has helped fund infra-structure projects in countries across Asia and beyond. Washington’s influence on the region, by contrast, has waned under President Donald Trump, especially after he withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) intended to reduce regional reliance on Beijing.
 
 Vietnam is playing a growing role in the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy to counter Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s attempt to recapture “center stage in the world.” In October, en route to Vietnam for his second visit this year, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis condemned Beijing’s “predatory economic behavior” against smaller nations. But Trump’s “America first” approach to foreign policy has weakened regional alliances. “Standing up to China is even more difficult for Vietnam under Trump than it has been,” says Carlyle Thayer, emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia.
 
 Although Vietnam’s economy is among the best performing in Asia, with GDP up 6.8% year on year in the second quarter of 2018, it relies heavily on trade with China. Bilateral trade is predicted to reach $100 billion, according to Vietnamese state media. Last year it had a $22.76 billion trade deficit with China, one that the TPP would have helped offset. Yet after thousands of years of subjugation, a virulent Sinophobia grips most of Vietnamese society. The two nations last fought a border war in 1979. Animosity has swelled alongside China’s growing assertiveness, especially over competing claims in the South China Sea.
 
 With that in mind, whether Washington can recruit Hanoi to its cause is a bellwether for other countries in the region seeking to balance China’s rise by reinforcing ties with the world’s pre-eminent superpower.

 Back in 2016, former U.S. President Barack Obama achieved a public relations coup when he sat down at a humble Hanoi restaurant with late celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain for bun cha, a fragrant noodle dish of grilled pork belly. Today the backroom table where they ate is enshrined in a glass cube, and “Combo Obama”—including a Hanoi beer—is the top choice on the menu.
 
 The paradox of Vietnam is that its leaders see Beijing’s authoritarianism as a governance model to replicate while its people remain pathologically wary of China’s ambitions, preferring better relations with the West. Obama’s visit and lifting of a ban on selling American weaponry to Hanoi in May 2016 helped boost rapprochement between the former foes. On March 5, Vietnam welcomed the first U.S. aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Carl Vinson, to dock since the end of the Vietnam War. Washington is also spending hundreds of millions of dollars on cleanup programs for contamination caused by Agent Orange.
 
 Vietnam is also rebranding itself as a Western-friendly tech hub. At a co-working space in central Hanoi, dozens of tech and media workers hammer at laptops, flanked by dwarf papaya and French windows. Here, in what some call the “Silicon Valley of Southeast Asia,” programmers can be hired for a fifth of the cost of the U.S. or Singapore. According to government figures, the country attracted $35.88 billion in foreign direct investment capital last year, up 44% from 2016.
 
 This outside investment is at risk, however, as a new cybersecurity law next year will tighten control of tech companies, requiring firms like Facebook and Google to store customers’ personal data locally, sparking privacy concerns. It mirrors a law already introduced in China, showing that Vietnamese policymakers are often happy to follow Beijing’s authoritarian path. Trong in particular values better ties with China. He has sent young cadres to China for exchange programs, and has emulated Xi by pursuing a sweeping anti-corruption campaign, which has netted top figures from business, the military and within the Communist Party.
 
 Vietnam’s human-rights record also echoes China’s approach to dissent. According to Human Rights Watch, Vietnam was jailing at least 119 prisoners of conscience as of January. In October, dissident blogger Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, known as Mother Mushroom, was forced into exile in the U.S. after being incarcerated for two years.“How can I think the new President will give us more freedom?” asks dissident singer Mai Khoi, who has been harassed and evicted because of her antigovernment lyrics. “If we get more freedom, it’s only because we fight for it.”
 
 Yet the issue that seems to bring people onto the street is still perceived encroachment on sovereignty by China. William Nguyen, 33, a Yale graduate from Texas, was arrested June 10 in Ho Chi Minh City at a protest against 99-year leases in special economic zones likely to be dominated by Chinese firms. For five weeks, he was held in the infamous Chi Hoa Prison, consisting of eight cellblocks circling a central courtyard with a single 20-m-high watchtower. “It was a seven-hour rotation of angry men screaming,” Nguyen tells TIME of his initial two-day interrogation, arms and feet shackled to a metal bar, during which he was allowed up only for toilet breaks and meals.

 Vietnam has never rolled over when its sovereignty has been challenged. It has been particularly outspoken when it comes to Beijing’s militarization of rocks and reefs in the strategic South China Sea, through which passes almost a third of all maritime trade. Violent demonstrations swept Vietnam in 2014 following China’s deployment of an oil rig in the disputed waters, with at least 21 deaths as some 100,000 protesters targeted Chinese-owned businesses. These disputed waters are an area where Hanoi’s priority aligns clearly with Washington’s. “We remain highly concerned with continued militarization of features in the South China Sea,” Mattis told reporters on his flight to Ho Chi Minh City.
 
 Elsewhere in Vietnam’s foreign policy, however, there are hurdles to rapprochement with the U.S. Vietnam is governed by the “three no’s” policy: no military alliances, no foreign bases in Vietnam and no reliance on another country for its defense. It has also mainly purchased Russian arms since the Cold War and in September placed a $1 billion order for assorted weaponry.
 
 This puts Vietnam in contravention of the 2017 Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which is aimed chiefly at penalizing the Kremlin over the Ukraine and Syria conflicts and the 2016 U.S. election. But in line with its growing strategic importance, Hanoi was granted a waiver (as were other U.S.-friendly nations, like Indonesia and India). Still, Vietnam nixed joint exercises between its navy and the U.S. Marine Corps, ostensibly in reaction to Washington’s criticism of the deal.
 
 “Vietnam welcomes the U.S. taking a stronger line with China but can’t stand shoulder to shoulder with us,” says a senior U.S. diplomat, speaking to TIME on condition of anonymity. “Vietnam can never be an American ally.”
 
 That doesn’t resonate with gallery owner Duk, who only sees young Vietnamese who loathe China and want to study in the West. “Only foreigners buy these posters now,” he says with a shrug. “Not even old people want to remember this history.” But for the Communist Party, the key strategy articulated in the posters remains constant: self-reliance, keeping both friend and foe at arm’s length. That is unlikely to change under Trong. The system stays in place even as its art fades away.

 The ballistic missile test, India’s fifth, “poses a direct threat to China’s security as well as a big challenge to the global efforts of nuclear-nonproliferation,” China’s Global Times writes. The missile, called the Agni 5, was launched from eastern India on Thursday and traveled 3,000 miles, the New York Times reported, putting China’s coastal cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, in range. India’s last missile test was in Dec. 2016.
 
 The missile is India’s most advanced in its Agni series—the name means fire in Hindi—and is capable of delivering a payload of 1.5 tons, enough to carry a fusion-assisted fissile nuclear warhead, according to the Delhi Defense Review, an India-based security publication. “With a range of ‘easily more than 5,500 km’ [3,400 miles], the Agni-V clearly confers upon India the ability to hold all of China’s Eastern Seaboard cities at risk from Peninsular India,” the journal said.
 
 Other estimates have put the missile’s range at as much as 5,000 miles, with Du Wenlong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Military Science, previously telling the Global Times that India had “deliberately downplayed” the missile’s capacity to “avoid causing concern.”
 
 The test comes months after a military stand-off between India and China over the 34-square-mile Doklam Plateau, a Himalayan pass between China and Bhutan that India perceives as a strategic buffer. The rivals fought a war in 1962 over disputed borders, which have never been formally resolved. India also conducted joint military exercises with Japan this week in the Indian Ocean, a key area where China is attempting to exert greater economic influence as well as flex its muscles as a regional naval power.
 
 “India is trying to build a military system with Australia, Japan and the U.S. in order to keep a closer watch on China,” television military analyst Song Zhongping told the Global Times, adding that China should renew efforts in the Indian Ocean as part of its wide-ranging Belt and Road Initiative.

 Since K.P. Sharma Oli became the Prime Minister of Nepal in October 2015, he has made two overseas trips. The first of those, last month, was to India. The second, taking place this week, is to China.
 
 The choice of those two countries in quick succession, and the objectives of Oli’s respective visits, may signal a subtle geopolitical shift for the, landlocked nation, which is situated between the two giant neighbors.
 
 Nepal has traditionally been dependent on its southern neighbor India, through which around 65% of its trade passes. The Himalayan country's crucial dependency on India was underscored late last year, when protesters from the Madhesi ethnic community — claiming that Nepal’s recently promulgated constitution discriminated against them — blocked key checkpoints and prevented the passage of essential goods from India for nearly five months.
 
 Nepal accused the Indian government of sympathizing with the Madhesi protest and abetting the blockade, which resulted in a shortage of fuel , medicines and other vital supplies that nearly crippled the country. India has consistently denied the claim, even though it too had criticized the Nepalese constitution.
 
 “People are still questioning the motive of our southern neighbors,” says Subhash Ghimire, editor in chief of the Republica , a Nepali daily. “The general public here is still not very convinced that India wouldn’t do something like that again.”
 
 As relations with India soured, Nepal’s northern neighbor China came to the rescue with a deal to supply a third of the country’s required petroleum. The deal signaled to Kathmandu the importance of diversifying its trade away from India.
 
 “[The Nepal government] has been talking about opening transit to China, so that in times of crisis, like we faced the last couple of months, we can have some alternatives,” Rishi Raj Adhikari, executive director of the government-run Institute of Foreign Affairs (IFA) in Kathmandu, tells TIME.
 
 On Monday, soon after landing in Beijing, Prime Minister Oli signed a transit agreement that includes access to Chinese ports as well as the potential construction of rail links between the two countries. A subsequent joint statement released on Wednesday said a more comprehensive version of the petroleum deal is also in the works.
 
 “At the psychological level here in Nepal I think it’s a huge boost,” Ghimire tells TIME. “It’s a very timely visit, and the agreement definitely signifies it.”
 
 Although Oli claimed his February trip to New Delhi, days after the blockade ended, restored trust and brought bilateral relations back to normal, it was widely seen as something of a damp squib. Several agreements were signed, but most of them — as the Himalayan Times reported — were the outcome of earlier negotiations. The lack of a bilateral joint statement during the visit also raised several question marks, with rumors that India was still not prepared to publicly endorse the Nepalese constitution as Beijing unequivocally did this week.
 
 Even as Nepal looks northward, however, experts feel it cannot afford to spurn its southern neighbor and longtime ally.
 
 “You have Nepal somewhat difficultly positioned, because clearly it cannot alienate either [China or India],” says Alka Acharya, director of the New Delhi–based Institute of Chinese Studies. “The Chinese have proved more than responsive to what they feel are Nepalese concerns about India.”
 
 Adhikari, the IFA director, maintains that Nepal has no intention of diluting its relationship with India through China, rather seeing itself as a “vibrant bridge” between the two. But the Indian government has long been wary of China’s efforts to establish trans-Asian supply routes through its “one belt, one road” initiative — which Oli enthusiastically endorsed this Tuesday — seeing it as an effort to encroach on India’s sphere of influence.
 
 Nepal is by no means China’s only foothold in South Asia, Acharya clarifies, with India’s other neighbors Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka already participating in various aspects of the Chinese plan.
 
 “Nepal’s specific geopolitical location is making that extra edge,” she says. “It’s not as if [the Chinese] aren’t pushing the same agenda with India’s other neighbors, and they’re finding takers, but Nepal evokes particular resonance because of its particular complications between India and China.”
 
 Wedged between the world's two most populous nations, the prevailing notion is that Nepal is well positioned but must tread carefully going forward.
 
 “The relationship so far with China has been that whenever something goes wrong with India then we look up to the northern neighbor,” says Ghimire. “If we start playing the China card or the India card, I don’t think that’s going to help us.”
 
 Acharya explains that “deft diplomacy” on Nepal’s part must work in tandem with “bold thinking” by India and a degree of Chinese understanding of Indian concerns in the region.
 
 “Otherwise there’s going to be sulking on one side and pushing on the other,” she says, “and Nepal in the end is going to feel stifled rather than liberated.”","['minister', 'chinese', 'nepal', 'diplomatic', 'oli', 'nepalese', 'shift', 'prime', 'china', 'neighbor', 'india', 'nepals']","{'Bangladesh': 1, 'China': 13, 'India': 22, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'Nepal': 23, 'Pakistan': 1}",,,,,

 Casting his gaze over what is today a small cluster of industrial warehouses surrounded by mud roads and bush, Mr Wu can see an altogether brighter future. “We will have a five-star hotel, a golf club, a Walmart,” he says in a well-rehearsed pitch. “It will be like Dubai.”
 
 An electrical engineer by profession, Mr Wu’s journey to west Africa followed an assignment as a young man in Myanmar, where he worked for Power Construction Corporation of China, a state-owned group, upgrading the electricity grid. In 2011, hungry for more adventure, he packed his bags and headed for Nigeria, where, still barely 30 years old, he was tapped up to manage the Ogun State free trade zone, a private-public project in which the local government provides the land and Chinese enterprise the capital.
 
 Mr Wu is one of hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens — a common estimate is about 1m — who have ventured to Africa over the past two decades to seek their fortune. Like many who have ended up there, he sees in Africa’s raw energy and ambition an echo of the forces that were unleashed by Deng Xiaoping’s reforms of 1978.

 “It is like the China of the 1970s and 1980s when you could open a business and maybe earn a fortune,” he enthuses. “Those kind of fortunes are not possible in China today.”
 
 People like Mr Wu have been persuaded to test their ambition in far-flung corners of the world by tougher business conditions in China, where rising labour costs, industrial overcapacity and more stringent environmental standards are taking their toll. While many entrepreneurs have looked closer to home, to countries such as Cambodia, others have struck out to Africa.
 
 It is China’s massive infrastructure projects, including dams, railways, ports and telecommunications networks, that capture most attention. Between 2000 and 2014, the stock of Chinese investment in Africa went from 2 per cent of US levels to 55 per cent. McKinsey estimates that, at the current breakneck pace, China will surpass US levels within a decade.
 
 Washington has belatedly woken up to China’s growing presence which is transforming both the physical and diplomatic landscape of Africa. In December John Bolton, President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, accused China of using “bribes, opaque agreements and the strategic use of debt to hold states in Africa captive to Beijing’s wishes and demands”.

 Yet large companies such as Huawei, and big state-affiliated companies, such as China Bridge and Road, are not the only Chinese actors reshaping the continent. What officials in Washington may not fully understand is that thousands of hardscrabble entrepreneurs like Mr Wu, involved in everything from retail and factories to farming, are having just as big an impact.
 
 Irene Yuan Sun, an associate partner at McKinsey and author of a book on Chinese investment in Africa, says the influence is particularly strong in manufacturing.
 
 “Chinese manufacturing investment is the best hope that Africa has to industrialise in this generation,” she says. “Chinese involvement in Africa is not just about state-driven efforts. A just as large, if not larger, component is these private enterprises, which are more job-intensive, which localise quicker and which have a much larger economic and social impact.”
 
 When Mr Wu first came to Ogun, there was virtually nothing in place. The state’s free trade zone he manages is majority-owned by Guangdong New South Group, a private Chinese conglomerate with interests in everything from medicine to coal mining. Mr Wu’s team was given a 2.24 sq km patch of land and told to get on with it.
 
 Nigeria, like countries across Africa, has a huge infrastructure deficit. It lacks reliable power, water and all-weather roads. New South Group has had to build almost everything from scratch, including natural gas-powered generators and yet-to-be paved roads connecting the zone to Lagos and beyond.
 
 “It is like managing a country,” Mr Wu says of the zone, which is designed to be an enclave of efficiency and stability in Nigeria’s notoriously unpredictable business environment. “We have our own customs, our own police, our own operations. The government of Nigeria provided the land. We used all our own money to build everything else.”
 
 After seven years in operation, the free trade zone has 50 registered companies, including two ceramic manufacturers producing tiles and plates, a steel-pipe plant and factories making everything from furniture to tomato sauce. There is a printing business, a plastic recycling company and another specialising in construction materials.
 
 For Mr Wu, the next 15 to 20 years will see a massive expansion to 10,000 companies, 200 times the number today. “We will have eight different industrial sectors,” he says. “We will have different zones for electronics, for tiles, construction. In the future, we will have a university for research and development.”
 
 “Nigeria has the conditions to be a factory of the world,” says Zhou Pingjian, China’s ambassador to Nigeria. “It should become the factory of the world.”
 
 If that is Nigeria’s putative future, for now, Mr Wu and thousands of Chinese entrepreneurs in the country like him have to contend with the present. Manufacturing made up just 9 per cent of gross domestic product in 2017, according to the World Bank, and President Muhammadu Buhari — who was re-elected in February — has complained that Nigeria imports everything from toothpicks to tomato purée.
 
 Like other countries in Africa, Nigeria’s manufacturing ecosystem has withered since the 1980s, partly thanks to a poorly executed industrial policy that saw the state lavish billions on white elephant projects. An irony of Chinese entrepreneurs setting up factories in the country — and in other parts of Africa, such as Ethiopia and Rwanda — is that the import of cheap Chinese goods was another factor in destroying local production. Nigeria has also been hit by the oil exporter curse, which pushed up the exchange rate, making it cheaper to import finished goods than produce them. The country’s once thriving textile industry is today a pale shadow of itself.
 
 Because of a shortage of all but the most basic raw materials, most Chinese factories in Nigeria are limited to final assembly. They rely on imported parts and inputs, which means they need to access scarce foreign currency and coax supplies past sometimes obstructive port officials.
 
 “The currency volatility is just too high,” says Wing Liao, the founder of Winghan, a Chinese furniture brand with a factory in Ogun state. “When there is profit, a fluctuation in currency exchange rates can wipe it all out.”

 To get hold of foreign exchange, Chinese entrepreneurs have had to get creative. Many say they buy Nigerian raw materials, such as timber and marble, which they then export to buyers in China or Europe in exchange for Chinese renminbi. Rings of Chinese money-changers specialise in matching those needing foreign currency with willing Chinese buyers of Nigerian imports.
 
 “Once the ship leaves port and has its papers signed by the port authorities, you can collect your money,” says Ban Yushi, manager of a Beijing-based mining company.
 
 Lack of inputs and scarcity of foreign exchange are just two of the obstacles faced by Chinese entrepreneurs. Rightly or wrongly, they complain about the skill levels of Nigerian workers, the product of a state education system that has deteriorated over recent decades.
 
 “The machines are often too difficult to operate for local employees,” says Chen Donghua, a shoe factory manager at the Lee Group, a manufacturer owned by Hong Kong entrepreneurs. “But because local labour is cheap they can still package them by hand.” Mr Chen’s company provides training to employees who, he says, in practice have little above an elementary school education.
 
 Chinese businessmen also have to negotiate past Nigeria’s bureaucratic gatekeepers for permits and licences. “To visit a government official here, you best have around $6,000 to $10,000 with you,” says Mr Ban, the miner. “Otherwise, forget about getting an appointment.”
 
 There are cultural obstacles too. Across the continent, Africans accuse Chinese workers of refusing to integrate. Many of them choose to work in unmarked offices and dormitories, away from the prying eyes of authorities and potential competitors. They are accused of bringing in their own labour, though companies have quickly learnt they need to provide local employment if they want to stay in business.

 From the perspective of Chinese workers, thousands of miles from home in an unfamiliar environment, life can also be tough. “This place is very lonely,” says Peng Hong, who manages a medicine manufacturing company in Lagos and Kano, which employs around 350 Nigerians and 45 Chinese.
 
 Mr Peng arrived in west Africa in 2005 from landlocked Hubei province, in central China, where he says, “life is too hard”. Life has been hard in Nigeria too. “We import most of our food and cook for our Chinese employees,” he says. On the weekends, Mr Peng organises company outings for his mostly male employees to the supermarket or to Lagos’ only Chinese-style karaoke bar.
 
 Like many arrivals, Mr Peng has had to battle. “We had to clear all the trees, drill our water wells, rig our own electrical transmission lines,” he says. “When I first came here, we had to light candles after 4pm because there was no stable electricity. We could not sleep because of the heat, so we would sleep outside in the courtyard.”
 
 Chinese entrepreneurs complain too that the authorities talk big but often fail to deliver. The expansion of Ogun’s free trade zone, for example, is being held up by the state’s inability, or unwillingness, to buy up land from local chiefs, Chinese executives say.
 
 Chinese views about their host communities can be blunt. “Nigeria has the most thieves in the world,” says Thomas Liu, who runs the medicine company where Mr Peng works, using the sort of uncompromising language that grates from Accra to Kinshasa. “You have to avoid being tricked.”

 Yet despite their myriad complaints, they say fortunes beckon. “If I could give advice to my former self, it would be ‘move faster,’” says Kent Chan, manager of Grand Shine Construction Materials. He set up his first factory in Nigeria in 2015. “I actually wanted to come in 2014 but then Ebola broke out. If I had come that year, I think business would have been even better.”
 
 The influx is by no means limited to Nigeria. McKinsey estimates there are more than 10,000 Chinese businesses operating in Africa, 90 per cent of them privately owned.
 
 Drawing on the “flying geese” concept of Japanese economist Kaname Akamatsu, researchers at the China-Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies argue that, as costs in China rise, manufacturing will gradually shift to regions like Africa. Between 2000 and 2015, Chinese companies registered more than 1,000 African manufacturing proposals with the commerce ministry in glass, recycled steel, ceramics, gypsum board, textiles, dying, tanneries and shoe factories to name but a few.
 
 Chinese companies, including garment makers in Tanzania and Lesotho, relocated not only because of cheaper labour costs. They were also drawn by the prospect of tariff free exports to the US under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and to the EU under the Everything But Arms agreement. In Ethiopia, Huajian from China and New Wing from Hong Kong were attracted by the country’s high-grade leather, the researchers at SAIS found.
 
 Once companies gain a foothold in one country, many seek to expand. New South Group aims to open 10 industrial zones like the one in Ogun across Africa, starting with a 700- acre facility near the Kenyan city of Eldoret that began business in February. It plans to open in Ghana and Angola, where, as in Nigeria, reliance on oil exports has devastated local manufacturing.
 
 In Nigeria, as in much of Africa, Chinese investment provokes suspicion as well as praise, but for the most part officials welcome the attention. Jonathan Coker, Nigeria’s former ambassador to Beijing, says western warnings about Chinese investments are hypocritical.
 
 “Diplomats say we will become slaves of China. This is the propaganda of the west,” he says. Instead, he adds, Nigeria has much to learn. “China is 10 times the size of Nigeria’s population but they have developed a system that can take care of their people. These are the examples we want to adapt.”
 
 Not all Chinese entrepreneurs have a positive impact. In Madagascar, they are blamed for illegal exports of rosewood and zebu, a type of cattle. Chinese demand for African wildlife also fuels poaching from Zambia to Mozambique.
 
 Nor does Ms Sun see the arrival of Chinese entrepreneurs as a magic bullet. The author accepts that, along with the promise of factories and jobs, they may bring environmental degradation and friction with African communities.
 
 “But they are extremely entrepreneurial and they are doing profoundly important things,” she says. “Not all good, not all bad. But we have to pay attention.”","['mr', 'africa', 'nigeria', 'chinese', 'zone', 'trade', 'free', 'china', 'wu', 'ogun', 'investment']","{'Angola': 1, 'China': 18, 'Ethiopia': 2, 'Ghana': 1, 'Hong Kong': 2, 'Japan': 1, 'Kenya': 1, 'Cambodia': 1, 'Lesotho': 1, 'Madagascar': 1, 'Myanmar': 1, 'Mozambique': 1, 'Niger': 31, 'Nigeria': 31, 'Rwanda': 1, 'United States': 3, 'Zambia': 2}",,,,,

 Jin Liqun, AIIB’s president, said during an investment conference panel discussion that debt problems associated with China’s massive infrastructure drive were often the result of long-standing fiscal mismanagement.
 
 “The debt problems of these poor countries were accumulated over the years. I don’t think it’s fair to put it down to the Belt and Road initiative,” Jin said at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh.
 
 He appeared on a panel with World Bank President David Malpass, who as a senior Treasury Department official in the Trump administration was highly critical of Belt and Road lending, telling the U.S. Congress in December 2018 that it “often leaves countries with excessive debt and poor-quality projects.”
 
 Jin defended the program’s purpose as being aimed at upgrading infrastructure to improve the growth and development potential of many countries.
 
 “But we should learn from the history. For many countries I think the issue is not whether you borrowed the money from outside, it’s how you spend the money you borrow,” Jin said. “You spend it well or not.”
 
 He said China borrowed heavily from external sources over the past 40 years, but spent the money “judiciously” and never experienced a debt repayment problem.
 
 “You need to look at the debtor. The debtor will speak for themselves,” Jin said. He added that multilateral development banks such as the AIIB and World Bank help debtor countries prioritize which projects they should pursue and which can wait.
 
 Malpass agreed that it was important to invest in quality projects that benefit a country’s population and said there needed to be more transparency in infrastructure lending, including the collateral, liens and other terms to avoid hidden clauses in contracts.
 
 “The debt burden has been going up so fast that the end result has been quite a few projects that the people of the country didn’t need,” he said, without naming specific cases.

 Initiated in 2013 by the Chinese government, the BRI seeks to build a modern version of the Silk Road to link China with the rest of Asia, Europe and beyond through large-scale projects. It is one of the most ambitious infrastructure initiatives conceived.
 
 Latin America is projected to be the “bright spark” for Chinese investment throughout 2020, according to a report from Fitch Solutions, as more countries sign up to the initiative and Chinese companies obtain new contracts to construct and finance infrastructure projects in the region.
 
 China is Latin America’s second-largest trading partner, after the US. Trade between China and the region grew 19% year-over-year to US$307.4bn in 2019 from 2018, according to Fitch Solutions.
 
 Since 2017, Ecuador, Chile, Uruguay, Trinidad & Tobago, Panama, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador have signed agreements to cooperate with China on the BRI.
 
 As China’s President Xi Jinping seeks to strengthen ties with governments in the region, the country’s biggest state-owned firms are increasingly winning construction, energy and transportation projects.
 
 Earlier this month, utility China Yangtze Power completed a US$4bn bridge loan with the Bank of China, Industrial Commercial Bank of China, Santander in Hong Kong and MUFG supporting its proposed acquisition of Sempra Energy’s power assets in Peru.
 
 In November, power company State Grid Corp of China was seeking more than US$2bn in bank debt to finance the purchase of Sempra’s assets in neighboring Chile, sources told Refinitiv LPC at the time.
 
 “The favorite strategy of the Chinese investor is to invest in a Latin American company that has a connection with China, and they (China’s banks) prefer to lend bilaterally,” said a managing director at a US investment bank, adding that the country’s banks generally fund deals directly or on a club basis.
 
 ICBC and the Bank of China, for example, are providing US$600m in debt to help construct an oil refinery at the Mexican port of Dos Bocas, China’s Ambassador to Mexico Zhu Qingqiao told reporters on January 13 at a Mexican economy ministry event. The refinery is estimated to cost up to US$8bn, according to various media reports.
 
 China Civil Engineering Construction Corp on January 7, signed a contract to build the Regiotram de Occidente, an elevated rail line in Colombia’s capital Bogotá, and the firm is after US$300m in debt to finance the operation, banking sources said.
 
 DUE DILIGENCE
 
 As Chinese-backed projects progress in Latin America, the pace of BRI-related works could slow down in 2020, as the Chinese government works to improve transparency and sustainability on financing with BRI-linked countries, according to the January 8 report from Fitch Solutions.
 
 Given that most countries linked to the BRI are characterized as emerging markets that pose higher risks for investors, the scheme has faced some criticism. Many observers are fearful that opaque financing arrangements could lead to unsustainable debt and question whether the initiative is more about promoting Chinese influence than bringing development.
 
 “There has been criticism around the types of projects that were advanced and transparency around projects’ costs, sovereign debt and the sustainability of government finances impacted by loans,” said Matteo Addonizio, an analyst at Fitch Solutions.
 
 In Ecuador, for instance, by the end of 2018, the government had borrowed up to US$19bn in loans from China to fast-track development projects. The loans, which were partially repayable with oil shipments, became expensive as oil prices dropped.
 
 Ecuador has since struggled to tighten its fiscal deficit. In February 2019 it resorted to a US$10.2bn bailout package from international financial institutions including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
 
 Going forward, China’s approach to each country is expected to be more customized, according to Fitch Solutions. And this is likely to reduce reputational risk for China and help gain the trust of other BRI countries.

 Opaque procurement processes and the dominance of giant state-owned Chinese companies mean European companies get only “crumbs from the table,” the European Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report.
 
 It said the European Union should move to force Chinese companies that access the EU procurement market to operate under the same restrictions that EU companies do in China.
 
 “If the EU fails to play an active and competitive role, there is a real danger that it could eventually become little more than a peripheral market tacked on to the end of Eurasia,” the Chamber of Commerce said.
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) seeks to build a modern version of the Silk Road to link China with Asia, Europe and beyond through large-scale infrastructure projects that it has launched in more than 60 countries since 2013.
 
 European companies are merely “niche players” in the BRI, with just 20 chamber members of 132 survey respondents reporting that they had bid on BRI projects, chamber President Joerg Wuttke told reporters on Monday ahead of the report’s release.
 
 Those European companies that did get involved did so mainly through Chinese business partners or the government, and usually their role was to provide specific technologies or expertise that the Chinese side lacked, the report said.
 
 Both Chinese and foreign companies can participate in BRI projects through open, transparent means, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily briefing in Beijing on Thursday. Many European firms have participated in the BRI, he said.
 
 Chinese national champions were also gaining “monopolistic power” in some BRI countries by building digital infrastructure that involved complete packages of software and hardware based on Chinese standards, according to the Chamber’s report.
 
 Such companies benefited from heavy state support at home, which helped them beat international competitors.
 
 “Smaller, less developed countries that do not have the capacity for setting their own standards will certainly be put under considerable pressure to simply adopt Chinese standards,” the report said.
 
 The EU needed to allow its own companies to scale up by reviewing its competition law, it said. The EU’s own infrastructure initiative, the “Connectivity Strategy,” should also be prioritized as a “credible alternative” to the BRI.","['companies', 'standards', 'european', 'projects', 'chinese', 'belt', 'eu', 'chamber', 'crumbs', 'chinas', 'bri', 'infrastructure', 'group', 'business', 'road', 'firms']",{'China': 5},,,,,

 Making his first visit to the Southeast Asian country as leader, and the first of any Chinese president in 19 years, analysts say Xi will bid to revive stalled multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects central to his flagship Belt and Road Initiative described as a “21st century Silk Road”.
 
 He is scheduled to meet state counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and army chief Min Aung Hlaing in the capital Naypyitaw, as well with the heads of minor political parties.
 
 The two countries have had a historically sometimes fraught relationship, with many in Myanmar suspicious of the tremendous sway China holds over its smaller neighbor.
 
 Relations have warmed since China avoided joining in the international condemnation of Myanmar after a military campaign in 2017 forced more than 730,000 Rohingya to flee across the border to Bangladesh.
 
 U.N. officials said the Myanmar military offensive was executed with “genocidal intent”, though Myanmar says it was a legitimate counter-insurgency operation launched after militant attacks on security forces.
 
 A permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China has defended Myanmar on the global stage and is viewed as the biggest obstacle to a prosecution of its leaders at an international war crimes tribunal.
 
 China is the second biggest investor in Myanmar, behind only Singapore, according to data published by the World Bank. Myanmar’s exports to China, its largest trading partner, were worth $5.5 billion in 2018, while imports were worth $6.2 billion.
 
 “No other country is investing in Myanmar except China,” said Hla Kyaw Zaw, a political analyst based in Yunnan province on the Myanmar-China border. “China can negotiate a good deal with Myanmar,” she said.
 
 Chinese vice foreign minister Luo Zhaohui told reporters in Beijing on Friday the purpose of the visit was to strengthen relations, deepen Belt and Road co-operation and “materialize” the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, a plan for a y-shaped corridor of projects connecting China with the Indian Ocean.
 
 “Preparations are underway and you will see the historic outcomes and influence of this historic visit,” Luo said.
 
 ‘LIKE WATER IN THEIR HANDS’
 
 Chinese and Myanmar flags fluttered side by side along the roads in the capital, Naypyitaw, on Thursday ahead of Xi’s arrival, alongside banners bearing his portrait. Municipal staff cleaned the roads and tended to the gardens, while some hotels hung welcoming signs.
 
 Chinese authorities, including the ministry of information and embassy, have organized a series of events celebrating the Myanmar-China relationship, which marks its 70th anniversary this year, in the commercial capital of Yangon in recent days.
 
 At one event on Tuesday, Myanmar’s Minister for International Cooperation Kyaw Tin acknowledged concerns over the relationship before Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party came to power after a landslide election win in 2015.
 
 “But the relationship between Myanmar and China is stronger and closer than before and we are building trust between our countries,” he said. “It will be a very successful visit. It will bring lots of benefits.”
 
 But Chinese megaprojects carry political risk in Myanmar, viewed as wrecking the environment and causing large-scale displacement of villagers.
 
 On the agenda at the weekend’s talks are expected to be a deep-sea port in Rakhine state that was scaled down in 2018 over fears of a debt-trap and a now-suspended Chinese-backed $3.6 billion mega dam in the northern Kachin state, which would have flooded an area the size of Singapore, displacing tens of thousands of people.
 
 While Suu Kyi, a longtime democracy activist and Nobel laureate, once publicly criticized the dam, more recently she has urged ethnic Kachin people to keep an open mind.

 Lu Ra, a villager forced to leave her land to make way for the project after construction started in 2009, said she feared China would pressure Myanmar to renew the project.
 
 “We are like water in their hands,” she said.

 SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese equity investment in solar, wind and coal power projects in Belt and Road countries has surged from 2014 to 2019, with planned capacity up more than tenfold compared to the previous five-year period, environmental group Greenpeace said.
 
 The Belt and Road initiative is a Beijing-led program to boost economic and trade ties in dozens of countries in Asia, Europe and beyond, mostly through investments in energy and infrastructure.
 
 According to a study published by Greenpeace on Monday, China’s wind and solar power investments in Belt and Road countries amounted to 12.6 gigawatts (GW) since the initiative was launched in 2014. It had invested in just 0.45 GW of solar prior to 2014.
 
 The country has also invested in 67.9 gigawatts of new coal-fired power in Belt and Road countries since 2014, but Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Liu Junyan said the increase in the share of renewables should be welcomed.
 
 “Chinese investors’ ratio of coal to solar is now the same at home and abroad - both are still six-to-one (in favor of)coal, unfortunately, but I’m amazed to see what five years of equity investment in solar made possible,” Liu said.
 
 China has been building dozens of new renewable energy projects at home to reduce the share of coal in its total energy mix to 59% by the end of last year. It has also been encouraging its existing coal-fired power plants to install ultra-low emissions technology.
 
 But China has been criticized for funding coal-fired power projects overseas that would not meet its own emissions standards, with a study published earlier this year saying it is supporting more than a quarter of all new coal-fired plants worldwide.
 
 China is expected to put another 40 GW of solar power capacity in operation at home this year, energy officials said on Friday.
 
 China’s total coal-fired capacity also expected to rise by another 45 GW this year, with the total eventually expected to peak at around 1,300 GW, up from 1,140 GW at the end of last year, researchers from China’s State Grid said this month.","['total', 'gw', 'countries', 'projects', 'solar', 'coalfired', 'belt', 'investments', 'study', 'china', 'surge', 'energy', 'power', 'road', '20142019']",{'China': 8},,,,,

 Officially named the Belt and Road initiative, the Silk Road initiative unveiled in 2013 has been touted by China as a way to boost global development through expanded links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond, underpinned by billions of dollars in infrastructure investment.
 
 COSCO Chairman Xu Lirong told Reuters on the sidelines of the Belt and Road forum in Beijing that the state-owned conglomerate will sign a deal on Monday with Kazakhstan’s national railway company to take a 24 percent stake in a dry port in the Khorgos Eastern Gates special economic zone (SEZ).
 
 He declined to comment on the value of the investment but said that China’s Lianyungang port will also invest in the project, which borders China’s far western Xinjiang region.
 
 “We will sign the contract tomorrow to participate in the Khorgos Eastern Gates SEZ ... This will be a transhipment hub for handling goods carried by rail from China to Europe,” he said.
 
 The Khorgos Eastern Gate SEZ was established by the Kazakhstan government in 2011 to boost the country’s exports and covers 600 hectares area of land that houses a dry port, logistic and production zones, its website says.
 
 It is also one of the central hubs for a railway network connecting China and Europe, on which trains currently shuttle goods from laptops to wine between 27 Chinese cities and 11 European cities including London and Duisburg.
 
 Xu also said that the company planned to increase investment in countries involved in the Belt and Road initiative and that the company believes it has a duty to ensure smooth trade flows along the countries involved in the initiative.
 
 “We will formulate a more detailed plan for the region’s transport network and will increase our investment in these areas,” he told reporters.
 
 The Chinese shipping giant owns one of the world’s largest dry bulk and container shipping fleets as well as a network of ports including Greece’s Piraeus. In January it secured a 180 billion yuan ($26.1 billion) financing pledge from China Development Bank to support Belt and Road projects.

 But no major new projects were agreed during the two-day visit by President Xi Jinping, the first of any Chinese leader in 19 years. Analysts said Myanmar was generally cautious of investments by Beijing and was also being careful ahead of elections later this year.
 
 Still, Xi and Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi signed 33 agreements shoring up key projects that are part of the flagship Belt and Road Initiative, China’s vision of new trade routes described as a “21st century silk road”.
 
 They agreed to hasten implementation of the China Myanmar Economic Corridor, a giant infrastructure scheme worth billions of dollars, with agreements on railways linking southwestern China to the Indian Ocean, a deep sea-port in conflict-riven Rakhine state, a special economic zone on the border, and a new city project in the commercial capital of Yangon.
 
 They did not address a controversial $3.6 billion Beijing-backed mega dam, where work has been stalled since 2011, reflecting the contentiousness of Chinese investment in Myanmar, where many are uncomfortable with the sway Beijing has over its smaller neighbor.
 
 “While a large number of different agreements have been signed, there is no Big Bang here,” said Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based analyst with the International Crisis Group.
 
 “The overall impression is that Myanmar is being cautious about Chinese investment, especially ahead of elections planned later in the year, he said.
 
 “China will be hoping that this is an incremental step toward realizing its mega-infrastructure goals, and that further progress can be locked in over the coming months,” he said.

 ‘DERAILED’ BY WEST
 
 At a welcoming ceremony on Friday, Xi hailed a “new era” of relations between the countries.
 
 “We are drawing a future roadmap that will bring to life bilateral relations based on brotherly and sisterly closeness in order to overcome hardships together and provide assistance to each other,” Xi said. He was scheduled to leave later on Saturday.
 
 Suu Kyi called China “a great country playing an important role in the international affairs and the world economy” but urged for economic projects that avoid environmental degradation and benefit locals.
 
 Xi also met leaders from political parties in ethnic areas riven with civil conflict where Chinese infrastructure projects are underway.
 
 Sai Kyaw Nyunt, joint-secretary of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, one of the ethnic politicians invited to meet Xi, said it was only a handshake.
 
 “Our country is very small and powerless,” he said, “So they treat us that way.”
 
 The two countries have historically had a fraught relationship, but have moved closer since 2017, when Myanmar was internationally condemned for its treatment of minority Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state.

 More than 730,000 Rohingya were forced to flee western Myanmar after a military crackdown that the United Nations has said was executed with “genocidal intent”. China has defended the country on the global stage and is viewed as the biggest obstacle to a prosecution of its leaders at an international war crimes tribunal.
 
 An article in Chinese state media ahead of the state visit said Myanmar had been “derailed” by its engagement with the West and only China was willing to “pull Myanmar from the sludge”.
 
 “But after some turbulence, Myanmar realized there were double standards in the approach Western countries had taken on human rights issues and began to turn to China for diplomatic and economic help,” the article in the Global Times said.","['projects', 'state', 'kyi', 'courts', 'isolated', 'ink', 'deals', 'myanmar', 'chinese', 'later', 'economic', 'china', 'xi', 'international', 'road', 'suu']","{'China': 9, 'India': 1, 'Myanmar': 13}",,,,,

 The project was initially canceled by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who came to power after a shock election victory in May last year, as he followed through a pledge to renegotiate or cancel “unfair” Chinese mega-projects approved by his predecessor, Najib Razak.
 
 But in April, the close trade partners agreed to proceed with the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) at a cost of 44 billion ringgit ($10.7 billion), reducing it from 65.5 billion ringgit.
 
 The 640 km line (398 miles), with China Communications Construction Co Ltd (601800.SS) as the lead contractor, will connect Port Klang on the Straits of Malacca with the city of Kota Bharu in northeast peninsular Malaysia.
 
 The agreement to resume work on the project had immediately boosted confidence in Malaysia among foreign investors, China’s ambassador to Malaysia said at a ceremony in the coastal district of Dungun.
 
 Flanked by cranes and trucks parked near a partly completed section of a tunnel, Ambassador Bai Tian spoke of “a great wave” of potential Chinese investors coming to Malaysia for field studies, and he expected many of them to decide to invest.
 
 China is debt-heavy Malaysia’s biggest trade partner and the countries have close cultural ties too.
 
 Ambassador Bai said the completion of the ECRL, expected by December 2026, could more than double the number of Chinese tourists coming in to Malaysia from 3 million last year.
 
 Malaysia Rail Link, the project’s local partner, said in a statement that up to 70% of the workers will be local and that domestic contractors will get 40% of the civil works.
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been praised for its potential to speed up economic development in many developing countries but criticized for potentially saddling many of them with unsustainable debt.
 
 Malaysia’s Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told Reuters on Monday that Beijing had offered them more BRI infrastructure investments and that Kuala Lumpur would consider them “if the pricing is right”.

 Junior Industry Minister Michele Geraci said that if Italy did sign an accord when Chinese President Xi Jinping visits the country later this month, it would be non-binding and just “an initial framework”.
 
 However, in a sign there is no government unity on the issue, another junior minister cautioned against any such move, saying more thought had to be given about national security.
 
 “At this moment, I do not think we should proceed with the signature,” Foreign Ministry undersecretary Guglielmo Picchi wrote on Twitter.
 
 Both Picchi and Geraci represent the coalition, far-right League party.
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), championed by Xi, aims to link China by sea and land with southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, through an infrastructure network on the lines of the old Silk Road.
 
 Aside from boosting trade and investment, Xi aims to advance exchanges in areas such as science, technology and culture.
 
 Italian officials said Xi was due to visit Italy from March 22-24, and would spend at least one day in Palermo - the capital of the island of Sicily.
 
 “We are still negotiating the details of the MOU (memorandum of understanding) and it might, or might not be signed,” Geraci said. “It is an initial framework. It is not a contract, there are no commitments, there are no funds and no obligations.”
 
 Italy fell into recession at the end of 2018 for the third time in a decade and the government is eager to find ways to boost the economy and revive the stalled construction sector.
 
 PRESSURE
 
 The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the United States was irritated by the prospect of Italy joining the BRI, and had warned the project could significantly damage Rome’s international image.
 
 “We view BRI as a ‘made by China, for China’ initiative,” the newspaper quoted Garrett Marquis, White House National Security Council spokesperson, as saying.
 
 Geraci said he had not seen any sign the United States was annoyed or concerned.
 
 “Our goal does not seem to me to be controversial,” he said. “It is about helping companies do business.”
 
 An Italian diplomatic source told Reuters that Rome was facing “a lot of pressure” from China to sign a MOU, but added that if an accord was reached it would be “an empty box”.
 
 Picchi, who is close to League leader Matteo Salvini, said allowing China to help build Italy’s 5G high-speed telecom network and giving it access to other infrastructure was a security issue that needed further review.

 A number of European Union states have signed MOUs with China, including Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Greece, Malta, Poland and Portugal. If Italy signs, it would be the first Group of Seven major industrialized nation to do so.
 
 An EU spokesperson in Brussels said the EU was cooperating with Beijing on the initiative, but added that this was “on the basis of China fulfilling its declared aim of making it an open platform which adheres to market rules, EU and international requirements and standards”.
 
 Past EU optimism over dealing with China has turned to frustration over Beijing’s slowness to open up its economy and a surge of Chinese takeovers in critical sectors. There has also been pressure from the United States to shun China over espionage fears.","['deal', 'united', 'mulls', 'eu', 'preliminary', 'belt', 'sign', 'italy', 'china', 'xi', 'states', 'international', 'road']","{'China': 11, 'Greece': 1, 'Hong Kong': 1, 'Croatia': 1, 'Hungary': 1, 'Italy': 7, 'Malta': 1, 'Poland': 1, 'Portugal': 1, 'United States': 4}",,,,,

 Indonesia has not been among the biggest beneficiaries of China’s trillion-dollar push to create a modern-day Silk Road.
 
 Indonesia says this is because it has insisted any loan within the BRI framework is done on a business-to-business basis to avoid exposing the government in case of default.
 
 President Joko Widodo made the request for a special fund during a meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping on the sideline of a G20 summit in Japan last week, Indonesia’s Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told reporters.
 
 Indrawati has been given the responsibility of coming up with the fund’s structure, including a proposal to China on the size of the fund and the criteria for loans from it, she said.
 
 “I am currently doing a study about its form, its mechanism, the size of it and of course the consequences of its costs,” she said.
 
 Luhut Pandjaitan, coordinating minister for maritime affairs, separately told reporters the fund should provide loans “with low interest in regards to investment in Indonesia, in partnership with Indonesian companies”.
 
 Pandjaitan, who overseas Belt and Road projects in Indonesia, previously said the Indonesian government had offered China involvement in about 30 projects, worth $91 billion, during a second Belt and Road Forum in April.
 
 The most high-profile BRI venture in Indonesia is a $6 billion high-speed rail project connecting the capital, Jakarta, to the textile hub of Bandung, awarded to a consortium of Chinese and Indonesian state firms in 2015.
 
 The project has faced land ownership issues.
 
 Another controversial project is a $1.5 billion hydro-power plant, funded by Chinese banks and being built by the Chinese state firm Sinohydro, in the heart of the Batang Toru rainforest on the island of Sumatra, which is home to the endangered Tapanuli orangutans.
 
 Agus Djoko Ismanto, an executive of the power plant developer PT North Sumatra Hydro Energy, on Wednesday denied disrupting the orangutan habitat.

 Italy is studying mechanisms to monitor commercial accords signed under the “Belt and Road” memorandum agreement with China, as well as other measures to protect “strategic activities and national interests,” Conte told the Corriere della Sera newspaper.
 
 In separate comments to Corriere, a spokesman for the White House’s group of national security advisers, Garrett Marquis, warned the accord was “a political hazard.”
 
 “In some well documented instances China has been able to obtain as collateral guarantees strategic assets of countries that were not able to repay their debts,” Marquis was quoted as saying.
 
 China has denied its Belt and Road projects, which fund and build global transport and trade links in more than 60 countries, are a debt trap.
 
 Italy’s public debt runs at more than 1.3 times its domestic output and is the world’s third-largest in absolute terms.
 
 Corriere reported that the White House had warned Italy it would no longer be able to share sensitive information, such as intelligence reports, if the Rome government were to buy equipment from China’s Huawei.
 
 The United States has urged allies not to use products made by Huawei, the world’s biggest maker of telecoms equipment, saying they could enable Chinese state espionage.
 
 No evidence has been produced publicly and Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations. But several Western countries have restricted, or are considering restricting, the company’s access to their markets, fuelling speculation of U.S. pressure.

 Wang Shoujun, a standing committee member of the China People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), told delegates on Wednesday that China needed to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by “Belt and Road” and give more financial and policy support to its nuclear sector.
 
 “‘Going out’ with nuclear power has already become a state strategy, and nuclear exports will help optimize our export trade and free up domestic high-end manufacturing capacity,” he was quoted as saying in a report on the CPPCC’s official website.
 
 He said China needed to improve research and development, localize the production of key nuclear components, and grow both the domestic and foreign nuclear markets to give full play to the country’s “comprehensive advantages” in costs and technology.
 
 Wang, also the former chairman of the state-owned China National Nuclear Corp. (CNNC), said “Belt and Road” nuclear projects could earn Chinese firms as much as 1 trillion yuan ($145.52 billion) by 2030, according to more details of his speech published by BJX.com.cn, a Chinese power industry news portal.
 
 He said 41 “Belt and Road” nations already had nuclear power programs or were planning to develop them, and China only needed to secure a 20% market share to create five million new jobs in the sector, according to the news portal.
 
 CPPCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 
 China is in the middle of a reactor-building program it hoped would serve as a shop window to promote its homegrown designs and technologies overseas, especially its own third-generation reactor design known as Hualong One.
 
 But the pace of construction at home has slowed down amid technological problems and delays at some key projects, as well as a suspension of new approvals that lasted over three years.
 
 Wang, according to BJX.com.cn, said there was currently overcapacity among local nuclear manufacturers, but the domestic market value for nuclear equipment could reach more than 48 billion yuan a year within two years. He didn’t say how much it was worth currently.","['30', 'reactors', 'belt', 'yuan', 'power', 'domestic', 'china', 'nuclear', 'told', '2030', 'needed', 'official', 'road', 'according', 'build']","{'China': 10, 'Hong Kong': 1}",,,,,

 ROME (Reuters) - Italy will join China’s giant “Belt and Road” initiative only after satisfying itself that U.S. and European Union concerns over the infrastructure plan have no basis, Industry Junior Minister Michele Geraci was quoted as saying on Monday.
 
 Geraci’s comments came after a spokesman for the White House’s group of national security advisers, Garrett Marquis, on Saturday called the Chinese venture a “vanity project” that Italy should steer clear of.
 
 “Clearly we must make sure that EU and U.S. concerns (over the deal) are unfounded.

 LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond plans to attend meetings in China to discuss the country’s centerpiece international economic plans later this month, his department said.
 
 Hammond attended the previous Belt and Road forum in 2017 to discuss the mammoth project which envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending.
 
 President Xi Jinping’s new Silk Road initiative has been controversial particularly in Washington, which views it as a way to spread Chinese influence abroad and saddle countries with unsustainable debt, a charge Beijing rejects.
 
 The United States is locked in a trade war with China.
 
 Italy has already endorsed China’s ambitious project and Switzerland said on Tuesday it would sign an accord backing the initiative next month.
 
 Britain is keen to cement closer ties with Beijing as the world’s fifth largest economy looks to re-invent itself as a global trading nation after it leaves the European Union.
 
 The Treasury said Hammond would also discuss British-China bilateral economic and financial cooperation.
 
 His visit will be subject to a clear parliamentary schedule in London where lawmakers are still trying to find a breakthrough in Brexit talks. They are likely to face more crucial votes in parliament in the coming weeks.","['discuss', 'philip', 'initiative', 'washington', 'silk', 'belt', 'attend', 'chinas', 'meetings', 'forum', 'britains', 'plans', 'hammond', 'road', 'project']","{'Switzerland': 1, 'China': 5, 'Italy': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 The initiative, a key thrust of President Xi Jinping’s administration, has hit opposition in some countries over fears its opaque financing could lead to unsustainable debt and that it aims more to promote Chinese influence than development.
 
 China sought to tackle those concerns at a summit in Beijing last month, promising to make the program sustainable and green and follow international standards, especially regarding debt.
 
 The United States has been particularly critical, and Pompeo, speaking in London on Wednesday, slammed China for peddling “corrupt infrastructure deals in exchange for political influence” and using “bribe-fuelled debt-trap diplomacy”.
 
 In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said various people in the United States had been making “irresponsible comments” on the program, especially before the summit when, he said, such criticism reached a crescendo.
 
 “But what was the result? One hundred and fifty countries, 92 international organizations and more than 6,000 delegates from various countries attended the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, including 50 delegates from the United States,” Geng told reporters.
 
 “I think this is the international community taking actual actions to cast a vote of confidence and support in the Belt and Road initiative, and the best response to the words and actions of the United States.”
 
 In the past two days, some Americans have been “singing the same old tune”, seeking to attack and smear the program, he added.
 
 “They’re not fed up with saying it; we’re fed up with hearing it,” he said.
 
 “I want to remind them again, don’t overestimate your ability to create rumors, and don’t underestimate the judgment of others. If they want to, let them continue talking. We will continue getting on with things.”
 
 The spat has fueled already tense relations between Beijing and Washington, most notably over their trade war, which the two countries have been seeking to end.
 
 Vice Premier Liu He will hold talks in Washington on Thursday and Friday aimed at salvaging a deal that appeared to be unraveling after U.S. officials accused China of backtracking on earlier commitments and President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday.","['beijing', 'united', 'countries', 'belt', 'hearing', 'complaints', 'international', 'china', 'fed', 'states', 'program', 'road']","{'China': 6, 'United States': 5}",,,,,

 The 126 countries in the Belt and Road region now account for 28% of global emissions, but on their current trajectory, that could rise to 66% by 2050, researchers, led by Ma Jun, a special advisor to China’s central bank, said.
 
 That could mean global carbon levels would rise to nearly double the level needed to keep temperature increases to below 2 degrees Celsius, a major goal of the Paris agreement.
 
 “If B&RCs (Belt and Road countries) follow historical carbon-intense growth patterns... it may be enough to result in a 2.7 degree path, even if the rest of the world adheres to 2 degree levels of emissions,” the report said.
 
 The research was published jointly by China’s influential Tsinghua Center for Finance and Development, which provides recommendations to policy makers, along with London-based Vivid Economics and U.S.-based Climate Works.
 
 The study estimated that more than $12 trillion in infrastructure investment would need to be “decarbonised”, and called for safeguards to ensure existing low-carbon technologies and practices were implemented, although even that might not be enough to meet 2050 goals.
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative is a Beijing-led program aimed at boosting economic integration through infrastructure and energy investments in Asia and beyond. Signatory countries account for about a quarter of the global economy.
 
 Although China has promised to decarbonise its energy system, it has continued to approve and finance coal projects, using $1 billion in “green finance” to fund coal-fired power projects in the first half of 2019.
 
 According to a study by environmental group Greenpeace, China has also invested in 67.9 gigawatts of coal-fired power in Belt and Road countries since 2014, compared to 12.6 GW of wind and solar.
 
 China has also been criticized for investing in overseas coal-fired power projects using polluting technology no longer permitted at home.
 
 Li Gao, a senior Chinese climate official, told reporters on the sidelines of a briefing on Friday that as a matter of principle, China would not use outdated technology in overseas projects, but in practice this would depend on circumstances and the actual standards of the hosting country.","['countries', 'projects', 'silk', 'safeguards', 'belt', 'coalfired', 'climate', 'investment', 'study', 'clean', 'china', 'power', 'finance', 'plan', 'global', 'road', 'needs']",{'China': 7},,,,,

 The Pacific premier will meet President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang during his first official visit to the Asian giant starting on May 26, according to China’s foreign ministry.
 
 China’s footprint in the Pacific region has been growing in the past decade. Pacific governments now owe about $1.3 billion in concessional debt to China, raising fears in the West that the region was becoming more susceptible to Beijing’s diplomatic pressure and unsustainable debt burdens.
 
 Salwai told reporters during a visit to New Zealand’s capital Wellington that he would discuss with Xi how China could support Vanuatu’s infrastructure development as part of Belt and Road.
 
 “We are an independent country, and we can’t wait for grants to come,” he said, citing the need for projects in hard infrastructure like roads and ports, and also telecommunications, utilities, health and education.
 
 “Whether through grants or through loans we have to have money to build our infrastructure, we want to invest this money into economic sectors,” he said, adding that funneling money into productive projects would also help it pay back its existing debt and develop the economy.
 
 The small Pacific nation signed up for Xi’s hallmark Belt and Road infrastructure initiative in November alongside the seven other Pacific nations that recognize China diplomatically.
 
 Vanuatu owes around $130 million to China, which accounts for roughly half its external debt and represents just over 13 percent of its annual GDP.
 
 China has said that it is not creating unsustainable debt burden in the Pacific and providing development assistance at the request of governments.
 
 The issue ignited last year over media reports China wanted to establish a military base in Vanuatu after funding a wharf big enough to handle warships. Both China and Vanuatu denied the reports.","['beijing', 'pacific', 'visit', 'money', 'debt', 'belt', 'development', 'infrastructure', 'vanuatu', 'seek', 'assistance', 'china', 'xi', 'road']","{'China': 9, 'New Zealand': 1, 'Vanuatu': 6}",,,,,

 The Belt and Road Initiative is a key policy of President Xi Jinping and envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending.
 
 But it has proved controversial in many Western capitals, particularly Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and saddle countries with unsustainable debt through nontransparent projects.
 
 The United States has been particularly critical of Italy’s decision to sign up to the plan last month, the first for a G7 nation.
 
 In an apparent nod to these concerns, the communique reiterates promises reached at the last summit in 2017 for sustainable financing - but adds a line on debt, which was not included the last time.
 
 “We support collaboration among national and international financial institutions to provide diversified and sustainable financial supports for projects,” the draft communique reads.
 
 “We encourage local currency financing, mutual establishment of financial institutions, and a greater role of development finance in line with respective national priorities, laws, regulations and international commitments, and the agreed principles by the UNGA on debt sustainability,” it added, referring to the United Nations General Assembly.
 
 The word “green” appears in the draft seven times. It was not mentioned once in the summit communique from two years ago.
 
 “We underline the importance of promoting green development,” the draft reads. “We encourage the development of green finance including the issuance of green bonds as well as development of green technology.”
 
 The Chinese government’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, said on Friday that the Belt and Road project is not a “geopolitical tool” or a debt crisis for participating nations, but Beijing welcomes constructive suggestions on how to address concerns over the initiative.
 
 A total of 37 foreign leaders are due to attend the April 25-27 summit, though the United States is only sending lower-level representatives, reflecting its unease over the scheme.
 
 The number of foreign leaders at the April 25-27 summit is up from 29 last time, mainly from China’s closest allies like Pakistan and Russia but also Italy, Switzerland and Austria.
 
 China has repeatedly said Belt and Road is for the benefit of the whole world, and that it is committed to upholding globally accepted norms in ensuring projects are transparent and win-win for all parties.
 
 “We emphasize the importance of the rule of law and equal opportunities for all,” the draft reads.","['nod', 'united', 'communique', 'debt', 'sustainable', 'belt', 'financing', 'development', 'leaders', 'green', 'china', 'summit', 'concerns', 'road', 'urge', 'draft']","{'Austria': 1, 'Switzerland': 1, 'China': 5, 'Italy': 2, 'Pakistan': 1, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 Locked in a trade war with China, the United States has been particularly critical of Italy’s decision to sign up to the plan, the first for a G7 nation. Others in the West are less keen to jump aboard, although many have kept an open mind.
 
 Neutral Switzerland sees the BRI accord to be signed during Maurer’s trip as a way to support economic development, especially in central Asia.
 
 “The aim of the memorandum is for both parties to intensify cooperation on trade, investment and project financing in third markets along the routes of the Belt and Road Initiative”, the finance ministry said on Tuesday without giving more details.
 
 Maurer, who is also finance minister, will attend the second Belt and Road summit next week which is expected to draw around 40 foreign leaders.
 
 The first summit for Belt and Road — which envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending — was in 2017.
 
 Xi has also invited Maurer for a state visit on April 28 and 29, his ministry said. Swiss business and financial leaders will accompany Maurer on his eight-day China trip.
 
 Switzerland, one of the first Western states to recognize the People’s Republic, was the first country in continental Europe to reach a free trade agreement with China, its largest trade partner after the European Union and United States.

 Xi said market principles will apply in all Belt and Road cooperation projects and that his signature initiative to recreate the old Silk Road joining China with Asia and Europe will deliver green and high-quality development.
 
 “More and more friends and partners will join in Belt and Road cooperation,” he said in his closing remarks. “The cooperation will enjoy higher quality and brighter prospects.”
 
 Xi and other top Chinese officials repeatedly sought to reassure partners and potential participants this week that Beijing does not intend to saddle them with high debts and wants BRI to benefit all parties involved.
 
 A joint communique issued at the conclusion of the summit said that leaders had agreed to project financing that respects global debt goals and promotes green growth, in line with a draft seen by Reuters last week.
 
 In a separate statement China said it signed a memorandum of understanding with various countries including Italy, Peru, Barbados, Luxembourg, Peru and Jamaica.
 
 “All of this shows that Belt and Road cooperation is in synch with the times, widely supported, people centered and beneficial to all,” Xi said on Saturday.
 
 Data from Refinitiv shows the total value of projects in the scheme stands at $3.67 trillion, spanning countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, Oceania and South America.
 
 Some partner nations have complained about the high cost of projects of BRI, which was launched in 2013, while some western governments view it as a means to spread Chinese influence abroad, leaving poor countries with unsustainable debt.
 
 China said this week it would establish a framework on debt sustainability to “prevent and resolve debt risks” as part of its efforts to allay such fears.
 
 While most Belt and Road projects are continuing as planned, some have been caught up by changes in government in countries such as Malaysia and the Maldives.
 
 Xi did not elaborate on the types of deals signed this week. But on Friday China’s state asset regulator said that at least 17 central government-owned firms, including companies such as China Railway Construction Corp and Mengniu Dairy, signed deals at the Belt and Road summit.
 
 These deals totaled more than $20 billion in value, according to Reuters calculations.","['countries', 'projects', 'deals', 'belt', 'cooperation', 'chinas', 'billion', 'touts', 'china', 'signed', 'week', 'xi', 'road', '64']","{'Barbados': 1, 'China': 7, 'Italy': 1, 'Jamaica': 1, 'Luxembourg': 1, 'Maldives': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Peru': 2}",,,,,

 “The Belt and Road Initiative has tremendous potential to spread prosperity and sustainable development, touching as it does, potentially 70 percent of the world’s population, a project of truly epic ambition,” Hammond said.
 
 “The U.K. is committed to helping to realize the potential of the BRI and to doing so in way that works for all whose lives are touched by the project,” he added.
 
 “The BRI is an extraordinarily ambitious vision,” Hammond said. “To turn that vision into a sustainable reality, it must work for everyone involved.”
 
 Britain is eager to forge closer ties with Beijing. The world’s fifth-biggest economy will look to re-invent itself as a global trading nation after it leaves the European Union - though it remains unclear when there will be Brexit.
 
 Britain and China will hold the next round of their Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD) in mid-June in London, Hammond said on Thursday, after months of media reports that talks had been delayed by diplomatic tension.
 
 In the past, the EFD has been used to announce closer cooperation on trade and banking initiatives, and to sign commercial contracts.
 
 Speaking later to reporters, Hammond said he hoped to see progress on the Shanghai-London stock connect plan and other projects, though he did not give details.
 
 STRAINED TIES
 
 However, relations between London and Beijing have been strained in recent years, most notably after a British warship sailed close to islands claimed by China in the disputed South China Sea last August.
 
 Prior to that, China and Britain, which have talked of a “golden era” of relations, had agreed to look at the possibility of reaching a “top notch” post-Brexit free trade deal that promised an important political win for the British government.
 
 Hammond said while the two countries didn’t always agree on everything, relations were back on track.
 
 “I agreed yesterday a long agenda with Vice Premier Hu Chunhua and I’m confident that out of that agenda there will be significant deliverables when we meet in London in June,” he told reporters.
 
 Amid the upheavals on the domestic front after parliament three times rejected the Brexit deal negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May and other EU leaders, Britain has increasingly looked to China, including the Belt and Road.

 To unlock that private finance and reassure investors, a recognized infrastructure asset class for Belt and Road projects must be created, with standardized contract terms and dutiful reporting that global investors will recognize and trust, Hammond told the summit.
 
 To support the sheer scale of the initiative, private finance will need to play a bigger role in the infrastructure projects, he added.
 
 “Our offer is to bring together the best of Chinese manufacturing, engineering and construction, with the best of British project design and legal, technical and financial services expertise, as we promise the golden era of U.K.-China relations to deliver world class sustainable infrastructure for the 21st century,” he said.","['initiative', 'beijing', 'calls', 'sustainable', 'belt', 'british', 'chinas', 'china', 'britain', 'bri', 'relations', 'vision', 'hammond', 'road', 'project']",{'China': 10},,,,,

 BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s President Xi Jinping said on Friday the aim of his Belt and Road initiative is to advance win-win cooperation among countries and build a new platform for international trade, while also creating development opportunities for China.
 
 The next step in recreating the old Silk Road was to push the initiative toward high-quality development, with a focus on green infrastructure and finance, Xi said in a keynote speech at a summit on the Belt and Road initiative.
 
 The Belt and Road initiative championed by Xi has become mired in controversy, with some partner nations bemoaning the high cost of projects. China has repeatedly said it is not seeking to trap anyone with debt and only has good intentions.
 
 Western governments have tended to view it as a means to spread Chinese influence abroad, saddling poor countries with unsustainable debt.","['advance', 'goal', 'initiative', 'countries', 'debt', 'jinping', 'belt', 'chinese', 'cooperation', 'development', 'president', 'winwin', 'china', 'xi', 'road']",{'China': 4},,,,,

 BOAO, China (Reuters) - China Development Bank (CDB) has provided financing of over $190 billion for more than 600 projects of the “Belt and Road” infrastructure plan since 2013, CDB President Zheng Zhijie told the Boao Forum on Wednesday.
 
 As of 2018 end, the CDB’s outstanding international businesses in countries along the Belt and Road were $105.9 billion, accounting for 34 percent of the bank’s overall international businesses, Zheng said.
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) lies at the heart of China’s foreign policy strategy. It was incorporated into the ruling Communist Party constitution in 2017, reflecting President Xi Jinping’s desire for China to take a global leadership role.","['projects', 'provides', 'cdb', 'belt', 'bank', 'development', 'zheng', 'president', 'billion', 'china', 'forum', '190', 'international', 'road', 'businesses']",{'China': 5},,,,,

 The outstanding loans were up from 810 billion yuan at the end of March 2018.
 
 President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative, unveiled in 2013, aims to bolster a sprawling network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
 
 China’s massive lending on Belt and Road projects is facing criticism of “debt trap,” which some believe will aggravate the financial vulnerability of developing countries.
 
 Zhang Qingsong, president of EximBank, defended the initiative, saying projects financed by the bank had created jobs and boosted taxes in the countries involved.
 
 “The accusation of the debt trap is a false accusation, and a smear of the Belt and Road Initiative,” Zhang told a news conference.
 
 Zhang Chenxu, deputy general manager of the bank’s sovereign clients department, said the lender had picked high-quality projects to ensure its loans would be sustainable.

 By Ben Blanchard and Brenda Goh
 
 BEIJING, April 27 (Reuters) - China sought to put a gentler face on its massive plan to recreate the old Silk Road at a summit that ended on Saturday, saying it must do more to explain the programme and boost sustainability even as state media hit back at critics.
 
 President Xi Jinping has made the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as it is formally called, one of the cornerstones of his administration. But it has run into opposition in some countries over fears that opaque financing arrangements lead to unsustainable debt and that it is more about promoting Chinese influence than bringing development.
 
 China has at times reacted angrily to such doubts, tending to characterise critics as harbouring anti-Chinese prejudice and wishing to contain the country’s rise, while overlooking what Beijing says are genuine good intentions.
 
 The Belt and Road scheme seeks to build a modern version of the Silk Road to link China with Asia, Europe and beyond through large-scale infrastructure projects.
 
 On Friday, Xi told foreign leaders - including close allies such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan - that the initiative must be green and sustainable, adding that the plan would deliver “high-quality” growth for all.
 
 Meeting Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, Xi said Belt and Road was about promoting mutually beneficial, win-win international cooperation, not a “you lose, I win” scheme, according to a read-out from China’s Foreign Ministry.
 
 “We must explain this point to the world, to win even greater understanding and support,” the ministry paraphrased Xi as saying.
 
 China has been keen to show that Belt and Road is even winning acceptance in Western nations, especially after Italy became the first G7 country to sign on last month. Britain’s finance minister, France’s foreign minister and Germany’s economy minister all made the trek to Beijing for the event.
 
 Those countries reminded China of the need for high standards and transparency.
 
 French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told the summit that the success of Belt and Road projects “will depend on our determination to keep our commitments”.
 
 “Commitment to openness, commitment to transparency, commitment to fair competition and, of course, commitment to environmental sustainability as well,” he said.
 
 British Chancellor Philip Hammond said that for Belt and Road to be successful it had to deliver “the highest international standards of transparency, of governance, but also of environmental integrity”.
 
 “President Xi made a speech this morning in which he committed China to all of those things and set out his vision for the next stage of Belt and Road and we will be looking very carefully at how that is operationalised,” he said on Friday.
 
 Even Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of another good Chinese friend, Myanmar, said Belt and Road had to take into account realities on the ground.
 
 “The projects must not only be economically feasible but also socially and environmentally responsible and, most importantly, they must win the confidence and support of local communities,” she told the summit.
 
 This year’s summit was more low-key than the first one two years ago.
 
 Xi did not offer details of any new funding for the initiative, though he did announce deals worth more than $64 billion signed during the meeting.
 
 State media also reined back a propaganda offensive that in 2017 featured songs in awkward-sounding English on their social media feeds praising Belt and Road.
 
 TALKING DURIAN
 
 China’s fearsome propaganda machine was never going to be entirely absent, however.
 
 For example, China’s embassy in Thailand put out a video with a Chinese-speaking, animated durian showing how Belt and Road was good for the pungent-smelling fruit, regarded as a delicacy in Southeast Asia and increasingly popular in China, as better roads meant it could be exported faster and cheaper.
 
 “Thanks to the Belt and Road initiative, our journey has become smoother,” the durian explains.
 
 Beijing has been unable to win over Washington though, with no senior U.S. government officials appearing at the summit.
 
 The U.S. embassy in Beijing reiterated “serious concerns that China’s infrastructure diplomacy activities ignore or weaken international standards and best practices related to development, labour protections, and environmental protection”.
 
 The Global Times, a widely-read tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, said in a Friday editorial that the United States and other critics “have lost their abilities to use logic and common sense, and even rational thinking” when it comes to Belt and Road.
 
 “Lying, being far-fetched, and holding such opinions will not have any real influence,” it said. “BRI is a groundbreaking international endeavour for the 21st century.”
 
 While China has sought to sketch a clearer vision for Belt and Road, it has increasingly taken a defensive tone in saying what it isn’t.
 
 On the eve of the summit, on Wednesday, the People’s Daily WeChat account ran a question-and-answer piece to “verbally fight back with the facts” against critics.
 
 “Is the Belt and Road China creating a debt trap?” reads one of the questions.
 
 “The causes of a country’s debt are complex. Some have problems with the fundamentals of their economy, some are old accounts left over from history,” part of the answer reads.
 
 “The Belt and Road Initiative is only six years old. It’s utterly unjustifiable to simply blame the long-standing debt problems of these countries on China!”
 
 China put its best foot forward as host for the summit, offering foreign journalists uncensored internet access at the venues, and at least some senior officials happily chatted with the media on its sidelines, though Xi himself took no questions at a closing news conference on Saturday.
 
 In another softer side to Belt and Road, a list of 283 deliverables reached at the summit listed more than just traditional areas like railways and ports.

 The policy championed by Chinese President Xi Jinping has become mired in controversy, with some partner nations bemoaning the high cost of projects. Western governments have tended to view it as a means to spread Chinese influence abroad, saddling poor countries with unsustainable debt.
 
 While most of the initiative’s projects are ongoing, some have been caught up by changes in government in countries such as Malaysia and the Maldives. Projects that have been shelved for financial reasons include a power plant in Pakistan and an airport in Sierra Leone, and Beijing has in recent months had to rebuff critics by saying that not one country has been burdened with so-called “debt traps”.
 
 Xi launched the Belt and Road initiative in 2013, and according to data from Refinitiv here the total value of projects in the scheme is at $3.67 trillion, spanning countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, Oceania and South America.
 
 A draft communique seen by Reuters said that 37 world leaders attending the April 25-27 summit will agree to project financing that respects global debt goals and promotes green growth.
 
 Visiting leaders will be headlined by Russia’s Vladimir Putin, as well as Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan, a close China ally and among the biggest recipients of Belt and Road investment, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, which recently became the first G7 country to sign on to the initiative.
 
 The United States, which has not joined the Belt and Road, is expected to send only a lower-level delegation, and nobody from Washington.
 
 Some Belt and Road projects “are going through a period of rationalization and evaluation,” said Li Lifan, deputy director general of the Centre for Belt and Road Initiative Studies at the government-backed Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.
 
 The summit “will be a time for reflection and to talk about the hopes for the future,” he told Reuters.
 
 RHETORIC SHIFT
 
 Industry insiders and diplomats say that there has been a shift in the way Beijing has been pushing Belt and Road overseas since the first such summit two years ago.
 
 “The political part is handled by the foreign ministry now, not the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC),” said a senior Western diplomat in China, referring to the country’s state planner which drafted the initiative’s official outline in 2015. That shift occurred last year, he said.
 
 Other analysts said there was a noticeable change in China’s overseas efforts to market the policy in the second half of 2018. In an unusual move, at least 10 of China’s ambassadors and diplomats in countries such as Mexico and Kenya published letters in local media outlets to defend the initiative.
 
 Wu Ken, China’s new ambassador in Germany, acknowledged in his first speech on the job that there were “deep doubts” about Belt and Road.
 
 “I hope relevant people can overcome the ‘allergies’ they have towards the Belt and Road as soon as possible so China and Germany can cooperate to jointly tap the benefits from it,” he said earlier this month.
 
 German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a confidant of Chancellor Angela Merkel, will attend the summit.
 
 William Klein, minister counselor for political affairs at the U.S. embassy in Beijing, told a forum earlier this month that the United States continued to have concerns about the Belt and Road.
 
 “These concerns, for example, are opaque financing practices, poor governance and a failure to adhere to internationally accepted norms and standards.”
 
 Andrew Davenport, chief operating officer at Washington-based consultancy RWR Advisory, which has been tracking Belt and Road investment, said China has become more reactive in its positioning of the initiative since the last forum.
 
 “It’s relatively clear that the Belt and Road narrative being put forward by Beijing over the past several months is designed to counter the criticism and push back,” he said.
 
 SUBDUED
 
 While the number of foreign leaders due at the summit is up from 29 last time, the run-up to the event has been subdued compared with the 2017 meeting.
 
 Two years ago, the weeks before the summit’s opening day were marked by a series of music and explanatory videos published by state media to advertise the Belt and Road initiative while the government announced the dates publicly roughly a month before.
 
 There has been no such media blitz this year besides a handful of documentaries and advertisements, and Beijing only confirmed the dates last Friday, less than a week before the opening.
 
 In events held to talk about Belt and Road before the summit, Chinese officials stressed that the initiative remained a “win-win” and an attractive opportunity for countries willing to become partners.
 
 On Monday, NDRC official Xiao Weiming told a media briefing that Chinese companies had invested $90 billion in countries benefiting from Belt and Road and handed out between $200 billion-300 billion worth of loans between 2013 and 2018.
 
 “The Belt and Road initiative is an open and inclusive idea,” he said. “As long as any country is willing to work with China, we will all have gardens along the Belt and Road.”","['initiative', 'beijing', 'countries', 'projects', 'minister', 'belt', 'recalibrate', 'media', 'china', 'criticism', 'summit', 'scheme', 'road', 'defend']","{'China': 10, 'Germany': 2, 'Italy': 1, 'Kenya': 1, 'Maldives': 1, 'Mexico': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Pakistan': 2, 'Sierra Leone': 1, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 David Malpass, fresh from a senior Trump administration post at the U.S. Treasury Department, is instead making his first foreign trip as the World Bank’s leader to sub-Saharan Africa to highlight his vision for the bank’s poverty reduction and development agenda.
 
 The World Bank Group said in a press release that Malpass will visit Madagascar, Ethiopia and Mozambique April 29-May 3, meeting with leaders, stakeholders and visiting World Bank-funded projects. His trip will include the port city of Beira, which was devastated by Cyclone Idai in March.
 
 World Bank Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva, who had been acting president during the leadership selection process, is representing the institution at the summit and had accepted China’s invitation before Malpass started at the bank on April 9, a World Bank spokesman said.
 
 Former World Bank President Jim Yong Kim attended China’s first Belt and Road summit two years ago.
 
 Leaders of two of the countries on Malpass’ trip, Ethiopia and Mozambique, are among a number of African leaders also attending this year’s summit.
 
 Malpass, who was the Treasury’s undersecretary for international affairs, is a longtime critic of China’s Belt and Road lending practices and had worked to raise alarms about them with G7 and G20 countries.
 
 “In lending, China often fails to adhere to international standards in areas such as anti-corruption, export credits, and finding coordinated and sustainable solutions to payment difficulties, such as those sought in the Paris Club,” Malpass told a U.S. House Financial Services subcommittee in December.
 
 His absence coincides with a significant downgrade of the Belt and Road summit by the United States as the Trump administration tries to negotiate a deal to resolve longstanding trade and intellectual property disputes with China.
 
 No high-level U.S. officials are attending, a State Department spokesman said, citing similar concerns about Belt and Road debt.
 
 Malpass said in a statement that it was important to increase Africa’s development momentum to boost growth, raise incomes and tackle climate resilience because the world’s poorest are increasingly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa.
 
 “I have chosen the African continent for my first official visit as World Bank Group president, recognizing the difficult challenges for leaders in promoting economic growth, security, and good governance,” he said.
 
 The bank said he would focus the visit on promoting economic stability, building resilience and using private sector partnerships to build resources for development.
 
 He told reporters on his first day on the job that he wanted to “evolve” the bank’s relationship with China to one where Beijing is a bigger contributor of capital and cooperates more closely with the bank on development issues and poverty reduction.
 
 But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Malpass’ former boss, on the same day told U.S. lawmakers that the World Bank under Malpass’ leadership and a new U.S. development agency “can be a serious competitor to (China’s) Belt and Road.”","['skips', 'africa', 'malpass', 'banks', 'belt', 'bank', 'development', 'chinas', 'leaders', 'president', 'summit', 'trip', 'world', 'road']","{'China': 8, 'Ethiopia': 2, 'Madagascar': 1, 'Mozambique': 2, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 Xi’s plan to rebuild the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond has aroused controversy, as some partner nations have bemoaned the high cost of infrastructure projects.
 
 China has not said how much the ambitious plan will cost, but some independent estimates suggest it will run to several trillion dollars.
 
 Beijing has repeatedly said it is not seeking to trap countries that sign up to BRI with debt. It will use this week’s summit in Beijing to address those concerns and recalibrate the policy.
 
 Xi said in a keynote speech on Friday that environmental protection must underpin the initiative “to protect the common home we live in”.
 
 “Operate in the sun and fight corruption together with zero tolerance,” Xi said.
 
 “Building high-quality, sustainable, risk-resistant, reasonably priced, and inclusive infrastructure will help countries to fully utilize their resource endowments,” he said.
 
 At the first summit, in 2017, Xi said Chinese banks would lend 380 billion yuan ($56.4 billion) to support BRI cooperation. He did not give a figure for the new financing in his opening remarks at the summit, but he is schedule to give another speech, on Saturday.
 
 Western governments have tended to view the plan as a means to spread Chinese influence abroad, saddling poor countries with unsustainable debt.
 
 While most of the BRI projects are continuing as planned, some have been caught up by changes in government in countries such as Malaysia and the Maldives.
 
 Those that have been shelved for financial reasons include a power plant in Pakistan and an airport in Sierra Leone, and Beijing has rebuffed critics by saying that not one country has been burdened with so-called “debt traps”.
 
 Since 2017, the finance ministries of 28 countries have called on governments, financial institutions and companies from BRI countries to work together to build a long-term, stable and sustainable financing system to manage risks, China’s finance ministry said in a report released on Thursday.
 
 Debt sustainability has to be taken into account when mobilizing funds, the ministry said in the report, which outlined a framework for use in analyzing debt sustainability of low-income BRI nations and managing debt risks.
 
 Xi launched BRI in 2013, and according to data from Refinitiv, the total value of projects in the scheme stands at $3.67 trillion, spanning countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, Oceania and South America.
 
 “The BRI is an extraordinarily ambitious vision. To turn that vision into a sustainable reality, it must work for everyone involved,” British finance minister Philip Hammond said at the summit.
 
 The potential benefits are clear, but to deliver them, BRI must operate according to the highest global standards with all parties working together within the rules-based international system to create genuine win-win outcomes for all, he said.
 
 CHINESE PROMISES
 
 The BRI will also create development opportunities for China just as the country itself is further opening its markets to the world, Xi said.

 He said China will “improve laws and regulations, regulate government behavior at all levels in administrative licensing, market supervision and other areas, and clean up and abolish unreasonable regulations, subsidies and practices that impede fair competition and distort the market.”
 
 Xi promised to significantly shorten the negative list for foreign investments, and allow foreign companies to take a majority stake or set up wholly-owned companies in more sectors.
 
 Tariffs will be lower and non-tariff barriers will be eliminated, he added.
 
 China also aims to import more services and goods, and is willing to import competitive agricultural products and services to achieve trade balance.
 
 VISITING LEADERS
 
 Summit attendees include Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan, a close China ally and among the biggest recipients of BRI investment, as well as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, which recently became the first G7 country to sign on.
 
 Khan told the summit that in a world of uncertainty, the initiative offered “a model of collaboration, partnership, connectivity and shared prosperity”.
 
 Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen took aim at critics who have described Belt and Road as a debt trap, pointing to the successful example of a Chinese-funded highway between Phnom Penh and the port city of Sihanoukville.
 
 “Cambodia has not only been able to plan this project for the benefit of the people but also achieve financial engineering that does not increase public debt to the state,” he said, in comments translated into English.
 
 European countries have signaled their willingness to participate in the BRI, but key states like France and Germany have said China must in turn improve access and fair competition for foreign firms.

 Major European Union countries want to sign a memorandum of understanding on the BRI as a group and not as individual states, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said.
 
 The United States, which has not joined the Belt and Road, is expected to send only lower-level officials, and nobody from Washington.
 
 “We continue to have serious concerns that China’s infrastructure diplomacy activities ignore or weaken international standards and best practices related to development, labor protections, and environmental protection,” a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said.

 The investment policy championed by Chinese President Xi Jinping has become mired in controversy, with some partner nations bemoaning the high cost of projects. But China’s recent efforts to put a greener face on its infrastructure initiative could smoothen ties with some countries.
 
 “It seems more likely that we can find a win-win situation with China, whether it’s greening the Belt and Road, or helping address some of the issues...around transparency or whether it’s using our regulatory systems, which are amongst the best in the world,” New Zealand’s trade minister David Parker said at an annual China-focused business summit in Auckland.
 
 Parker had traveled to Beijing for the Belt and Road summit in April at which New Zealand had joined Russia and four developing nations to coordinate accounting standards for countries participating in Belt and Road.
 
 Amid Western scrutiny and a U.S. backlash towards Belt and Road, New Zealand’s stance could be a litmus test on how other governments respond to China’s trade and investment plan.
 
 “The fact that we’ve taken a little bit of pause as we’ve worked to really flesh out that arrangement has been no bad thing because Belt and Road has really evolved,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told the summit, adding that the infrastructure program was changing to involve sectors such as service industries.
 
 The small Antipodean nation has long been touted by Beijing as an exemplar of its “firsts” with Western countries, most recently becoming the first Western nation to join the Chinese-spearheaded Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and helping to usher in other developed nations.
 
 But the relationship had hit a stumbling block in recent months under Ardern’s coalition government.
 
 New Zealand has criticized China’s lending to the Pacific, and rejected a bid to allow Chinese technology giant Huawei to take part in the country’s planned 5G network.
 
 An agreement, one of the first with a Western nation on Belt and Road penned under the previous centre-right National government in 2017, had languished months past its 18-month expiry date. Since then Italy and Switzerland have also signed up to the initiative.
 
 But Ardern, who recently returned from her first trip to Beijing as premier, said on Monday that disagreements were normal and the relationship with China was one of New Zealand’s most important.
 
 Two-way trade between the two countries has topped NZ$30 billion ($19.9 billion) and the government hoped it would grow further once negotiations were completed on an upgrade of the two nations’ historic free trade agreement.
 
 Parker said that taking part in Belt and Road could improve the relationship between the two nations because it was “very important” to the Chinese administration, “which then creates a space for trade”.
 
 China’s ambassador to New Zealand, Wu Xi, welcomed New Zealand’s offering up its regulatory expertise to Belt and Road, but encouraged a bold idea proposed by some businesses and trade experts to develop New Zealand into a transport and trade hub between Asia and Latin America.
 
 “(Belt and Road) needs New Zealand’s ideas, New Zealand’s creativity and New Zealand’s energy,” she said.
 
 Air New Zealand was among the businesses backing the proposal.

 Along with others in Africa, Uganda has received large credit lines from China in recent years as part of the Asian giant’s so-called Belt and Road Initiative, aimed at rebuilding the old Silk Road connection with Asia, Europe and beyond.
 
 However U.S. officials have been critical of Belt and Road lending, which they say can leave countries with excessive debt.
 
 Construction of the so-called oil roads would accelerate efforts to commence crude oil production in Uganda, which has failed to take off 14 years after crude reserves were discovered in the country’s west.
 
 The money will be borrowed from China’s Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, according to a statement issued by the government that listed decisions taken at a cabinet meeting on Monday.
 
 The statement said the roads are needed to “facilitate the efficient development and production of the strategic national oil resources”. It did not give details on the total length of roads to be built.
 
 Uganda’s oil fields are in the Albertine rift basin near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Reserves are estimated at 6 billion barrels.
 
 France’s Total co-owns the fields in equal stakes with China’s CNOOC and UK’s Tullow Oil.
 
 Crude production has been repeatedly delayed over the years by spats over taxes and a lack of requisite infrastructure like tarmac roads in the fields, a crude export pipeline and a refinery.
 
 A new impasse over taxes on Tullow’s planned divestment of part of its stake in the fields is seen as potentially pushing the production target of 2022 to a later date.
 
 Last week the IMF cut its economic growth projection for Uganda for the July 2019 to June 2020 financial year, citing tardy progress with oil production.
 
 The Washington, DC-based institution also warned Ugandan authorities to exercise fiscal discipline and maintain debt sustainability.
 
 Uganda’s public debt, the IMF calculates, is expected to hit the key benchmark of 50% of GDP as early as the 2021/22 financial year.","['total', 'uganda', 'crude', 'mln', 'roads', 'fields', 'key', '118', 'taxes', 'china', 'statement', 'road', 'borrow', 'production', 'oil', 'build']","{'China': 4, 'Congo': 1, 'France': 1, 'Uganda': 7}",,,,,

 Di Maio was responding to U.S. concerns at the prospect of a key ally supporting the Chinese initiative. A spokesman for the White House’s group of national security advisers, Garrett Marquis, on Saturday called the Chinese venture a “vanity project” that Italy should steer clear of.
 
 The “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI), championed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, aims to link China by sea and land with southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, through an infrastructure network on the lines of the ancient Silk Road.
 
 Aside from boosting trade and investment, Xi aims to advance exchanges in areas such as science, technology and culture.
 
 “I have heard the alarm being raised from the United States yesterday about this deal on the Silk Road that Italy wants to sign with China,” Di Maio said at an event organized by supporters of his ruling 5-Star Movement.
 
 “Let it be clear that, if we are looking at the Silk Road towards China for our exports, it is not to strike a political deal with China but only to help our companies,” he said.
 
 He added that Italy was an ally of the United States and respected its concerns, but that the Chinese market was hungry for “made in Italy” products and know-how.
 
 On Friday, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that he might sign a framework deal on the venture when Xi visits Italy from March 22-24.
 
 A number of European Union states have signed memorandums on the BRI with China, including Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Greece, Malta, Poland and Portugal. If Italy signs, it would be the first members of the Group of Seven industrial powers to do so.
 
 Washington argues that China is saddling poor nations with unsustainable debt through large-scale infrastructure projects that are not economically viable, and is using the project to further its political and strategic ambitions.
 
 Italy fell into recession at the end of 2018 for the third time in a decade and the government is eager to find ways to boost the economy and revive the stalled construction sector.","['deal', 'silk', 'chinese', 'belt', 'xi', 'political', 'italy', 'help', 'china', 'maio', 'deputy', 'prime', 'sign', 'states', 'exports', 'road', 'wants']","{'China': 7, 'Greece': 1, 'Croatia': 1, 'Hungary': 1, 'Italy': 9, 'Malta': 1, 'Poland': 1, 'Portugal': 1, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 Ambassador Jia Guide made the announcement to guests at a private party in Lima alongside Peru’s vice president, as China kicked off a three-day Belt and Road summit in Beijing that Peru’s trade minister and leaders from around the world are attending.
 
 The deal will make Peru one of a few Latin American nations to formally join the China’s flagship infrastructure policy, underscoring how countries around the world are being drawn into China’s orbit by the promise of investment and despite U.S. objections.
 
 Vice President Mercedes Araoz said Peru’s relationship with Washington would remain strong.
 
 “Signing this memorandum of understanding is the start of a cooperation model that China has proposed to the world which...will allow us to broaden our ties,” Araoz told Reuters at the event following Jia’s announcement.
 
 “We’ve established very strong bilateral relations with China as we have with the United States,” Araoz added.
 
 Chinese President Xi Jinping first pitched its “One Belt, One Road” policy in 2013 as a way to expand Beijing’s links with Asia, Africa and Europe through billions of dollars in infrastructure investments.
 
 But early last year, China invited Latin American and Caribbean countries to sign up as well, as it seeks to deepen its ties in a resource-rich region where U.S. influence is historically strong.
 
 Chile, which like Peru is a close ally of the United States, announced in November that it was joining the initiative.
 
 Peru’s decision to sign up as well comes within two weeks of a state visit from U.S. Secretary of State, who repeatedly warned about the risks of what he described as Chinese predatory lending on his recent four-nation tour of South America.
 
 China’s finance minister said at the start of the summit that Beijing aims to make the Belt and Road initiative sustainable and prevent debt risks, seeking to allay criticism that its infrastructure plan fuels indebtedness in participant countries and lacks transparency.
 
 China overtook the United States as Peru’s largest trade partner years ago, thanks largely to its imports of copper and other minerals from the South American country. Chinese investments in Peru remain focused on mining, but have broadened to include infrastructure in recent years.","['days', 'united', 'peru', 'mou', 'chinese', 'belt', 'coming', 'chinas', 'infrastructure', 'china', 'club', 'perus', 'sign', 'states', 'join', 'world', 'road']","{'Chile': 1, 'China': 11, 'Peru': 11, 'United States': 4}",,,,,

 BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s massive Belt and Road infrastructure program should only go where it is needed and where the debt it generates can be sustained, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Friday.
 
 In brief remarks to nearly 40 world leaders and other high-ranking officials at China’s second Belt and Road summit in Beijing, Lagarde said the program to build ports, railroads and other trade-enhancing infrastructure was having a positive impact on growth in certain countries but needed to be managed carefully.
 
 She called for a revamped “Belt and Road 2.0” to include increased transparency, an open procurement process with competitive bidding and better risk assessment in project selection.
 
 “History has taught us that, if not managed carefully, infrastructure investments can lead to a problematic increase in debt,” Lagarde said in remarks prepared for delivery at the conference. “I have said before that, to be fully successful, the Belt and Road should only go where it is needed. I would add today that it should only go where it is sustainable, in all aspects.”
 
 Lagarde said that Chinese authorities were taking positive steps with a new debt sustainability framework that will be utilized to evaluate projects.
 
 The sustainability initiative was announced on Thursday as China seeks to allay concerns that the Belt and Road plan to boost trade links was saddling poor countries with debts they cannot repay.
 
 She also applauded the launch of a green investment principle for Belt and Road projects at the Beijing conference, emphasizing low-carbon and climate resilient investments.
 
 “Debt sustainability and green sustainability will strengthen BRI sustainability,” Lagarde said.
 
 The IMF chief said the Belt and Road initiative was helping to stimulate infrastructure investment and developing new global supply chains. She cited a new manufacturing zone in Kazakhstan linked to Belt and Road and construction of a highway in Senegal linking three cities to the country’s main airport, which has helped underpin strong growth.","['beijing', 'imfs', 'debt', 'second', 'sustainable', 'belt', 'chinas', 'infrastructure', 'lagarde', 'sustainability', 'needed', 'international', 'road']","{'China': 4, 'Kazakhstan': 1, 'Senegal': 1}",,,,,

 HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s Belt and Road Initiative can pave over only some of its potholes. A gathering in Beijing this week to promote the $1 trillion-plus foreign policy push comes after a bumpy year for the flagship scheme, from Pakistan to Malaysia. Under pressure, China has shown some welcome flexibility. But U.S. hostility is ramping up too, and that will be far harder to repair.
 
 Leaders attending the summit, which starts on Thursday, will see a recalibrated version of President Xi Jinping’s signature initiative. That’s sensible, given unprecedented trouble across the nearly global programme. The biggest block came in Malaysia, where a new government last year suspended construction on a Chinese-backed rail project linking the country’s east and west coasts. Pakistan – among the top recipients of Belt and Road largesse – has put on hold many projects in the $62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Several other nations, from the Maldives to Myanmar, are wrestling publicly with the scale of deals made with the People’s Republic.
 
 To its credit, Beijing is taking some of the criticism on board. It agreed, for instance, to slim the Malaysian rail project’s scope and original price tag by more than 30 percent. It provided Islamabad with additional lending to head off a potential financial crisis, and may be preparing to sign a first phase of new development aid projects for the country. Chinese banks too seem pickier these days about evaluating new projects.
 
 But the past months have turned up a threat bigger that reluctant recipients – an increasingly aggressive Washington. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence struck an overtly hostile tone when he cautioned countries last year that the United States did not drown its partners in debt, or offer “a constricting belt or a one-way road”. Senior diplomats have warned of China’s so-called debt traps and payday lending practices. A U.S. advisory team was even dispatched to Myanmar to help the country scrutinise Chinese deals, the Wall Street Journal reported.
 
 The danger is that tough talk eventually morphs into a geopolitical stand-off, with poorer countries forced to choose between Chinese or U.S.-backed support. That dynamic will be much harder for Beijing to fix than a hefty loan. In the long run, it may also prove far more damaging for everyone involved.","['beijing', 'projects', 'potholes', 'belt', 'breakingviews', 'chinese', 'recipients', 'rail', 'fix', 'president', 'pakistan', 'xi', 'road', 'repairs']","{'China': 5, 'Hong Kong': 1, 'Kenya': 3, 'Maldives': 1, 'Myanmar': 2, 'Malaysia': 3, 'Pakistan': 3, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 By Cindy Silviana and Fanny Potkin
 
 JAKARTA (Reuters) - The Indonesian-Chinese consortium building a high-speed rail link between the capital Jakarta and the textiles hub of Bandung expects to earn $18 billion developing satellite towns and industrial centers along the line, a company official said.
 
 The rail project, part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond was described last month by China’s ambassador to Indonesia, Xiao Qian, as “the first high-speed rail of Southeast Asia”.
 
 After nearly three years of delays over land ownership disputes, construction on the rail line, which is financed principally by a $4.5 billion loan from China’s Development Bank, finally kicked into gear in 2018..
 
 The chief executive of Wijaya Karya (WIKA), which heads the Indonesian side of what is the most high-profile of several Belt and Road projects in Indonesia, said that the state-owned construction firm expects to book 266 trillion rupiah ($18.7 billion) from four transit-related developments by 2070.
 
 The Indonesian side, which also includes state rail company KAI, owns 60 percent while the Chinese, led by the China Railway Engineering Corporation, holds the rest.
 
 WIKA CEO Tumiyana - who uses only one name - said that 15 percent of the line has been completed, with 60 percent to be finished by the end of 2019.
 
 Analysts say the plan to develop four new towns and industrial centers mimics China’s own approach to high-speed rail development.
 
 “This seems like it’s copying the general model of China’s urban development - if you build it, they will come,” said Nick Marro, a China analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
 
 One of the sites previously visited by Reuters on an old tea plantation is due to be transformed into a sleek 5,000 hectare city with high-rise blocks and the campus of a new university.
 
 Indonesian and Chinese officials say the project’s success will be a gauge for future infrastructure cooperation.
 
 A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously told Reuters “it’s a major project for the mutual benefit and cooperation between China and Indonesia and helps promote local economic and social development”.
 
 Indonesian vice-president Jusuf Kalla recently headed a delegation to China’s BRI forum, where it pitched to Chinese companies for up to $91 billion of infrastructure projects.
 
 Jakarta insists on a business-to-business structure for all potential BRI deals instead of China’s traditional government-to-government loan format, which has limited the amount of overall projects.","['projects', 'towns', 'indonesia', 'chinese', 'belt', 'rail', 'satellite', 'chinas', 'link', 'billion', 'china', 'bri', 'expects', 'line', 'indonesian', 'road', 'highspeed']","{'China': 10, 'Indonesia': 8}",,,,,

 Italy, seeking new export deals to boost its stalled economy, will become the first Group of Seven major industrialized nation to join the multi-billion-dollar project, which is designed to improve Beijing’s global trade reach.
 
 Xi is due to meet Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Friday and is set to sign the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Saturday before traveling to the Sicilian capital Palermo.
 
 More than 30 deals, worth up to 7 billion euros, are also expected to be agreed during the trip in an array of sectors, including accords opening up the northern ports of Trieste and Genoa to Chinese containers.
 
 “We are at the heart of the Mediterranean, yet the Chinese are everywhere in the region except here,” junior industry minister Michele Geraci said in a video on his Facebook page.
 
 However, the prospect of the accord has caused ructions both within the coalition government and among Italy’s allies — notably in Washington, where the White House National Security Council urged Rome not to give “legitimacy to China’s infrastructure vanity project”.
 
 And on the very day that Xi flew into Rome, European Union leaders in Brussels considered adopting a more defensive strategy toward China, having last week branded the world’s second largest economic power a “systemic rival”.
 
 The European Union has grown increasingly frustrated by what it sees as China’s slowness to open its economy and by a surge of Chinese takeovers in critical EU sectors, accusing it of distorting local markets.
 
 Rome says such concerns should not stop it improving its ties and points to the fact that 13 EU countries have already signed MOUs with China, including Hungary, Poland and Greece.
 
 “We have weighed up all the risks and I think this is a great result for Italy,” said Geraci, who lived in China for a decade before joining the government last year.
 
 Geraci later added that a Chinese company might even come to the rescue of Italy’s perennially sickly national airline, Alitalia, which is struggling to find the foreign suitors it needs to stay solvent.
 
 However, in a concession to Washington, the government moved hastily this week to protect its telecoms sector from foreign predators amid concerns that Italy might expose itself to hi-tech espionage as a result of closer links with Beijing.
 
 China has shrugged off the controversy, with its vice foreign minister saying it was “hard to avoid misunderstandings” over the burgeoning Belt and Road project.
 
 The initiative is aimed at creating a modern-day Silk Road, reviving the ancient trade routes that connected east and west. More than 150 countries, regions and international groups have already signed pacts with Beijing.

 President Emmanuel Macron wants to forge a united European front to confront Chinese advances in trade and technology. Xi’s visit also provided a stage for protesters seeking more European action over the alleged mistreatment of minorities in China.
 
 “Europe must be united and have a coherent message. That’s what we are doing on strategic investments,” Macron said in a joint address with Xi. Neither leader took questions.
 
 After Macron and Xi meet on Monday, the two will hold further talks on Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the European Union executive.
 
 Xi arrived in France after visiting Italy, the first Western power to endorse China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative as Rome tries to revive its struggling economy.
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plan, championed by Xi, aims to link China by sea and land with Southeast and Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, through an infrastructure network on the lines of the old Silk Road.
 
 France says Silk Road cooperation must work in both directions.
 
 Macron said European firms needed better access to China, more trust in their exchanges and a tangible improvement in the business environment and fair competition. He said the BRI had to meet international norms.
 
 The two sides signed 15 business deals totaling about 40 billion euros ($45 billion), including an order for 300 Airbus planes estimated at 30 billion euros alone.
 
 The contracts ranged from the renewable energy sector to shipping and banking. Macron also said China has agreed to lift an embargo on French poultry.
 
 CHALLENGE AND PARTNER
 
 In a column in the French daily Le Figaro published on Sunday, Xi made clear he wanted Paris to cooperate in the Belt and Road project, calling for more trade and investment in sectors ranging from nuclear energy to aeronautics and farming.
 
 “It’s up to us to work with France to develop a global and strategic partnership that is more robust, stable and dynamic,” Xi said alongside Macron. “We want our development to benefit others and that’s the case with the BRI.”
 
 French officials describe China as both a challenge and partner, saying France must remain especially vigilant over any Chinese attempts to appropriate foreign technology for its own purposes.
 
 The EU is already weighing a more defensive strategy on China, spurred by Beijing’s slowness in opening up its economy, Chinese takeovers in critical sectors, and a feeling in European capitals that Beijing has not stood up for free trade.
 
 As part of efforts to further that approach, Macron will play host to Merkel and Juncker on Tuesday to meet with Xi to move away from a purely bilateral approach to ties.
 
 “Macron is not happy to see China win so many prizes in Rome, so he has invented a bizarre European format by inviting Merkel and Juncker as a counterbalance to show that he is the driving force behind European integration,” said one Paris-based Asian diplomat.
 
 Rights organizations also urged Macron not to skirt the subject of human rights in China, especially Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region.

 Several hundred demonstrators converged in central Paris on Monday with slogans protesting against the alleged mistreatment of China’s Muslim Uighurs and in defence of Tibet, 60 years after that region’s failed uprising against Chinese rule.
 
 “The European Union is based on respect for individual freedoms and fundamental rights,” Macron said. “That’s why France brings this issue up in its dialogue with China to express concerns that are ours and those of Europe on the question of respecting fundamental rights in China.”

 Recent Chinese naval deployments in the strategic waterway, through which more than $3.4 trillion worth of goods are transported annually, have reignited tension with Vietnam and the Philippines. Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have competing claims in the South China Sea.
 
 Malaysia had been critical of China’s South China Sea position, but has not been excessively outspoken recently, especially after China pumped in billions of dollars into infrastructure projects under its Belt and Road Initiative.
 
 Malaysia regularly tracked Chinese naval and coastguard vessels entering Malaysia’s territorial waters, but China respects Malaysia and had “not done anything that caused us trouble, so far”, Defense Minister Mohamad Sabu told Reuters last month.
 
 Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi told a news conference with Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah that this year, tensions in the South China Sea had dropped.
 
 Littoral states and China were committed to continue appropriately handling the South China Sea issue and jointly safeguard peace and stability there, said Wang, who is the Chinese government’s top diplomat.
 
 “To this end, our two sides have agreed to set up a bilateral consultation mechanism for maritime issues, a new platform for dialogue and cooperation for both sides,” he said.
 
 Abdullah, who referred to Wang as “my brother”, said the mechanism would be led by the two countries’ foreign ministries.
 
 “Our officers will be discussing the details, but I think this is one important outcome of the meeting today and also the 45 years of our diplomatic relations,” he said.
 
 China is debt-heavy Malaysia’s biggest trade partner and the countries have close cultural ties too.

 Watch interviews from the inaugural Singapore-China Belt and Road Initiative Investment Forum, where Omar Shahzad, Group CEO, Meinhardt Group; Goh Chye Boon, Regional CEO (China), Mapletree Investments; and Marie Lam-Frendo, Regional Director, Atkins Acuity, discuss opportunities along the Belt and Road.
 
 At the first Singapore-China BRI Investment Forum on 25 October 2018, senior government officials and industry practitioners from across the region shared their insights on this gargantuan project via panel discussions on the third-party market collaborations, and the demand for professional advisory services along the BRI.
 
 Ning Jizhe, Vice-Chairman, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China, discussed that the impetus of BRI is to contribute to the global economy. China and Singapore’s cooperation will create a greater and more open world economy, pushing towards greater cooperation and peace.
 
 Mr Ning Jizhe, Vice-chairman, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China, emphasised the importance of third-party market collaboration at the Singapore-China Belt and Road Initiative Investment Forum.
 
 In its simplest form, the BRI is about improving collaboration and connectivity within the region. But when one considers the sheer size and scale of this trans-continental initiative, it is anything but simple, and the ambition behind the project is obvious.
 
 In his speech, Mr Ning spoke about cooperation as the precursor of development for many projects. Therefore, China and Singapore should look towards sharing the risk of projects.
 
 Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry, Singapore, continued with the theme of collaboration, recognising that “the success of the BRI will depend on how we, as partners and stakeholders, work together to shape this initiative going forward.”
 
 “Protectionism will result in fragmentation and isolation of production and value chains,” continued Mr Chan. “Instead, we should work together towards a more, not less, integrated and inter-dependent ecosystem...[that] encourage[s] stronger partnership with shared ownership of the global system.”
 
 Singapore was an early supporter of the BRI when it was first introduced by China’s President Xi Jinping in 2013. One-third of all Chinese outward investments to Belt and Road countries flows through the city-state, and Singapore has now overtaken the US as the most attractive destination for Chinese overseas direct investment, according to a 2017 study by the Economist Intelligence Unit.(2)
 
 Listen to the interview with Omar Shahzad, Group Chief Executive Officer, Meinhardt Group
 
 With almost 62% of the global population affected by the BRI(3), industry practitioners at the BRI Investment Forum 2018 highlighted language and cultural divides, with many asserting that a local partner can help bridge these differences, and the importance of trust between partners.
 
 “It’s very important to have a local power to lead investors through the difficulties of land acquisition, building infrastructure and cultural differences,” said Setyono Djuandi Darmono, Founder and Chairman of Jababeka Group. Dr Ruan Qiantu, Chairman of State Grid Corporation of China and Singapore Power-backed Jemena Group, which owns energy and water transportation assets across the east coast of Australia, added that “mutual respect and patience is imperative.”
 
 Yet with over 1,500 Chinese investment-backed infrastructure projects(4) in Belt and Road countries underway since 2013, speakers on the Financing Projects and Safeguarding Businesses Along the Belt and Road panel flagged concerns about financing such a breadth of projects.
 
 “For us, the infrastructure financing gap is a big one and we see the quality of the projects as a major challenge,” said Pang Yee Ean, Director-General of Investment Operations at Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). “This situation is challenged by rising interest rates. We will see more and more projects not being able to fund the gap. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel, because there will be some projects that don’t make the cut and it will differentiate the good projects from the others.”
 
 Listen to the interview with Marie Lam-Frendo, Regional Director, Atkins Acuity
 
 With its unique multicultural and multilingual background, Singapore is an ideal launchpad for many BRI initiatives, particularly when one considers the close socio-cultural ties the city-state enjoys with many of its neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia and beyond.
 
 “The strength of Singaporean companies is that they understand the Chinese way of working,” said Omar Shahzad, Group Chief Executive Officer, Meinhardt Group. “Plus, they can speak Mandarin and communicate in the local context – that’s really the value add.”
 
 Singapore’s reputation as one of the region’s top financial and trading hubs also means the city-state can offer top-notch talent from a diverse pool of industries, be it in finance, legal, advisory or infrastructure. Many international banks, law firms and multi-national corporations have set-up their regional headquarters in Singapore, making it an ideal springboard for BRI projects around the region.
 
 “The whole value chain – be it legal, financial, technical – can be structured from here,” says Meinhardt’s Shahzad. “In some ways, this also de-risks Belt and Road projects by adding a Singapore component to it, and jointly those projects have a better chance of succeeding.”

 BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s President Xi Jinping said on Sunday that the country will promote the globalization of Shanghai’s financial markets through the Belt and Road Initiative, and the city should strive to master the core links of the industry chains.
 
 The financial hub should courageously jump into the ocean of the world’s economy and fight the storms to build strong tendons and strengthen the bones, Xi said on a tour in Shanghai ahead of an import fair next week.
 
 The newly expanded free trade zone (FTZ) in the city will serve as a hub to develop the onshore and offshore businesses in a coordinated way and a springboard for corporate overseas ambitions, Xi said.","['city', 'shanghais', 'hub', 'welcome', 'promote', 'markets', 'jinping', 'zone', 'weekthe', 'president', 'china', 'globalization', 'xi', 'worlds', 'financial']",{'China': 2},,,,,

 “We think this is critically important,” Mnuchin told a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee. “We’re not ever going to be using money from these international organizations to pay back China.”
 
 Some countries saddled by debt from Belt and Road Projects, such as Pakistan, have turned to the IMF for assistance. Pakistan entered a $6 billion loan program with the Fund in July 2019.

 Conte has faced calls from home and abroad not to sign the document, amid fears Italy might expose sensitive technologies to China or hand over critical infrastructure.
 
 Rome has denied any such risk.
 
 A five-page draft of the MOU reveals a wide-ranging accord full of broad undertakings, but short on specific details. Here are some of the main points of the document that has not been finalised and could yet be changed.
 
 PREMISE:
 
 Italy and China share a common history, with Italy serving as the traditional landing place for the maritime Silk Route.
 
 The two countries reaffirm their commitment to the U.N. charter to promote sustainable development and the Paris Accord on climate change. They also recognize the guiding principles of the EU Strategy to connect Europe and Asia adopted in 2018.
 
 PRINCIPLE OBJECTIVES:
 
 The two countries commit to work together on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), thereby strengthening their political relations and commercial ties, and promoting regional peace.
 
 AREAS OF COOPERATION:
 
 - A policy dialogue and a commitment to work together with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
 
 - Transport, logistics and infrastructure: The two countries say they will work on areas of mutual interest, such as roads, railways, bridges, civil aviation, ports, energy and telecommunications. They stress the importance of open and transparent tenders.
 
 - Removing obstacles to commerce and investment. They commit to cooperation in “third-country” markets and promise to “counter excessive macroeconomic imbalances, and to oppose unilateralism and protectionism”.
 
 - Financial collaboration, strengthening “bilateral coordination on fiscal, financial and structural reform policies” and favoring the partnership between the respective financial institutions.
 
 - Connectivity between people. Develop a twinning network between cities and encourage cultural, science, tourism and education exchanges.
 
 - Environmental cooperation, promoting sustainable and ecological development.","['factbox', 'financial', 'countries', 'promoting', 'mou', 'outlines', 'belt', 'sustainable', 'cooperation', 'strengthening', 'work', 'italy', 'broad', 'sign', 'specifics', 'road', 'investment', 'draft']","{'China': 2, 'France': 1, 'Italy': 4}",,,,,

 Jump forward two millennia and Italy now wants to play a pivotal role in the new Silk Road being created by Chinese President Xi Jinping. But joining the latest incarnation is proving controversial and risky for Rome’s modern-day masters.
 
 Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte plans to sign a preliminary accord when Xi visits Rome next week, hooking Italy up to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) - a colossal, multi-billion-dollar project designed to improve Beijing’s trade reach.
 
 Italy’s drive to be the first Group of Seven industrialized nation to join the ambitious venture has angered Washington and alarmed Brussels, raising fears of a sellout of sensitive technologies and the handover of critical infrastructure.
 
 With ports that offer easy gateways into Europe’s richest markets, Italy is a promising and prestigious prize for China.
 
 In return for its endorsement, Italy’s government hopes for a boost in exports and investment that will lift its anemic economy out of its third recession in a decade.
 
 But diplomatic analysts and political foes say Rome has not weighed the geopolitical risks, failed to consult with its Western partners and underestimated growing concern about China’s burgeoning global aspirations.
 
 “I am afraid that up until now we have handled this in too amateurish a fashion, without any real coordination,” Lucio Caracciolo, director of the influential Limes geopolitical review, told Reuters.
 
 “My fear is that in the end we will lose on both counts, getting nothing substantial from China while the United States retaliates against us for having got too close to Beijing.”
 
 ITALIAN INERTIA
 
 Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who leads the populist 5-Star Movement, has spearheaded the pro-Beijing policy, setting up a China Task Force within the industry ministry that has the stated aimed of making Italy a “privileged partner” in BRI.
 
 He has visited China twice in eight months and effectively sidelined the foreign ministry on one of the most sensitive diplomatic issues of the day.
 
 Di Maio’s task force is led by junior industry minister Michele Geraci, who lived in China for 10 years before entering government in 2018. Neither he, Di Maio nor Conte had any experience of international diplomacy before last year.
 
 Geraci speaks Chinese and fervently backs closer ties with Beijing, saying Italy has fallen behind its partners.
 
 “When I returned to Italy I found a certain inertia when it came to China,” Geraci, a former economics professor, told Reuters last month. “We need to play catch-up.”
 
 According to Eurostat, Germany exported 93.8 billion euros ($106 billion) of goods to China in 2018, with Britain next on the list exporting 23.4 billion euros, France third with 20.8 billion euros and Italy fourth on 13.17 billion euros.
 
 “There is huge potential there that other countries are already taking advantage of,” said Geraci.
 
 But just as Italy adopts its new position, the rest of Europe seems to be having second thoughts.
 
 Earlier this week, the European Commission branded Beijing a “systemic rival” and called on European Union leaders to back its ideas to curb Chinese state-owned enterprises.
 
 The European Union has grown increasingly frustrated by what it sees as the slowness of China to open its economy and by a surge of Chinese takeovers in critical EU sectors, accusing it of distorting local markets.
 
 Rome says such concerns should not stop it forging closer ties and points to the fact that 13 EU countries have already signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with China, including Hungary, Poland, Greece and Portugal.
 
 However, the biggest EU exporters to China have not signed MOUs and those that have do not have much to show for it, said Lucrezia Poggetti, a research associate with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin.
 
 “They have been frustrated that vaguely phrased Chinese promises for economic opportunities have largely failed to materialize,” Poggetti told Reuters.
 
 “Signing up to the BRI without taking into account geopolitical considerations and without making concrete demands, hoping that one day you will get something in return economically, is very naive,” she said.
 
 AMERICAN ANGER
 
 The Belt and Road project lies at the heart of China’s foreign policy strategy and was incorporated into the ruling Communist Party constitution in 2017, reflecting Xi’s desire for his country to take a global leadership role.
 
 The United States, locked in a trade war with Beijing, worries that Xi’s initiative is designed to bolster China’s political and military influence, and could be used to spread technologies capable of spying on Western interests.
 
 “No need for Italian government to lend legitimacy to China’s infrastructure vanity project,” a spokesman for the White House’s national security advisers said on Saturday in a rare public rebuke for one of Washington’s staunchest allies.
 
 Refusing to back down, Italy has nonetheless tried to reassure the United States, releasing a draft of the MOU to show it offers up no firm commitments and makes no reference to the sort of technology transfers feared by Washington.
 
 Likewise eager to show that its pro-China policy is bearing fruit, the government has leaked reports that 50 agreements might be signed during Xi’s March 21-23 visit, including deals with oil company Eni, gas infrastructure firm Snam and shipbuilder Fincantieri.
 
 Italy also hopes to unveil projects to develop trade through its ports of Genoa, Trieste and Palermo. Although China’s COSCO Shipping has bought control of the largest port in Greece, Italy says it offers better entry points into Europe.
 
 “There is still much work to be done on the China deals, including what money is involved,” said a business source involved in the negotiations, who declined to be named.

 A welter of lucrative contracts would represent a badly needed victory for Di Maio, who is not only battling to soothe U.S. tempers, but is also struggling to sell the deal to his coalition partner, the far-right League.
 
 Even though Geraci is a member of the League, the group appeared blindsided when news of an imminent deal emerged last week, with party chief Matteo Salvini warning against the “colonialization” of Italy by China.
 
 “We are reviewing it,” Salvini, who serves as joint deputy prime minister with Di Maio, said on Thursday. “Before allowing someone to invest in the ports of Trieste or Genoa, I would think about it not once but a hundred times.”","['beijing', 'minister', 'potholes', 'belt', 'hits', 'chinese', 'italys', 'drive', 'chinas', 'italy', 'billion', 'china', 'maio', 'di', 'join', 'road']","{'China': 21, 'Germany': 1, 'France': 1, 'Greece': 2, 'Hungary': 1, 'Italy': 15, 'Poland': 1, 'Portugal': 1, 'United States': 3}",,,,,

 SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile will join China´s Belt and Road initiative, Foreign Minister Roberto Ampuero said on Thursday, in a move to deepen economic and political cooperation with the Asian powerhouse in a zone of strong U.S. influence.
 
 Ampuero said in a statement that joining China´s global infrastructure initiative would make Chile more attractive to Chinese investors and position the Andean nation as the “landing point for investments in Latin America.”
 
 The agreement is set to be signed on Friday, the statement said.
 
 China is Chile´s top trading partner, and the two countries are deepening ties. Last week, Chile and China signed a trade deal to streamline customs controls and widen access to the Chinese market for Chilean products.
 
 China has increasingly taken a more aggressive foreign policy position throughout Latin America as the United States, under President Donald Trump, has opted for a more protectionist stance.
 
 The “One Belt, One Road” initiative, proposed in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping, promotes expanding links between Asia, Africa and Europe, with billions of dollars in infrastructure investment.
 
 China has sought a bigger role overseas since Trump was elected, presenting its Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade agreement as an alternative to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the United States has abandoned.
 
 The country is already testing U.S. dominance in Latin America, offering the region $250 billion in investment over the next decade.

 Southeast Asia is increasingly skeptical of U.S. commitment to the region as a strategic partner and a source of security, while China’s reach is seen as growing both politically and economically, the study also showed.
 
 “The conventional wisdom that China holds sway in the economic realm while the United States wields its influence in the political-strategic domain will ... need to be revisited in light of the survey results,” it said.
 
 The survey by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, affiliated with the Singapore government, polled 1,008 respondents from all ten nations of the ASEAN grouping, drawn from government, academic and business communities, civil society and the media.
 
 Nearly half of the respondents said President Xi Jinping’s hallmark Belt and Road initiative would bring ASEAN “closer into China’s orbit,” while a third said the project lacked transparency and 16 percent predicted it would fail.
 
 A large majority, or 70 percent, said their governments “should be cautious in negotiating BRI projects, to avoid getting into unsustainable financial debts with China,” a view strongest in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.
 
 Some Western governments have accused China of pulling countries into a debt trap with the initiative, an accusation China has denied.
 
 China was seen by 73 percent of the respondents as having the greatest economic influence in the region and was also believed to have more influence politically and strategically than the United States.
 
 Six out of ten respondents said U.S. influence globally had deteriorated from a year ago and two-thirds believed U.S. engagement with Southeast Asia declined. About a third said they had little or no confidence in the U.S. as a strategic partner and provider of regional security.
 
 Fewer than one in 10 saw China as “a benign and benevolent power,” with nearly a half saying Beijing possessed “an intent to turn Southeast Asia into its sphere of influence”.
 
 The study’s authors wrote, “This result ... is a wake-up call for China to burnish its negative image across Southeast Asia despite Beijing’s repeated assurance of its benign and peaceful rise.”
 
 There was a call for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to play a more active role in Myanmar’s Rohingya crisis, although a majority of the respondents sought mediation rather than diplomatic pressure.
 
 The United Nations says 730,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from Myanmar’s Rakhine State to Bangladesh since the military’s crackdown on insurgent attacks.

 The New York-based lender is one of a handful of global banks promoting its cross-border capabilities to capitalize on President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road initiative.
 
 The initiative, unveiled in 2013, aims to bolster China’s global leadership ambitions by building infrastructure and trade links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond.
 
 “We’re seeing more and more multinational customers benefiting from Belt and Road, mostly through supplying into the Belt and Road projects, particularly companies in the industrial sector,” Christine Lam, Citigroup’s chief executive for China, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
 
 Lam was speaking on the sidelines of a conference hosted by Citigroup in Beijing this week.
 
 Rivals HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L), Standard Chartered (STAN.L), and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) also have promoted their cross-border capital markets and cash management services to leverage Belt and Road opportunities.
 
 China is one of eight Asian markets that produce $1 billion or more in revenue for Citigroup. The bank’s local unit reported about $770 million in revenue last year, representing a decline of 10.5 percent, following the sale of its stake in Guangfa Bank. Profits increased about 1 percent to $163 million.
 
 Citigroup has banking relationships with more than 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies in China, Lam said, and provides services in 58 markets in so-called Belt and Road countries.
 
 The bank expects to book more revenue from providing services for Belt and Road related activities, including mergers and acquisitions, cash management, trade finance and hedging, Lam said.
 
 Most Belt and Road opportunities are financed by government-owned policy and commercial lenders, with China Construction Bank Corp (601939.SS)(0939.HK) and Bank of China (601988.SS)(3988.HK) raising billion-dollar funds for future investment.
 
 Lam said that Citigroup is also looking to increase service to Chinese state-owned enterprises and other multinationals investing overseas, and has established nine China desks in locations around the world, including Dubai, Nairobi and Kazakhstan.
 
 Separately, Lam said that Citigroup has already benefited from ongoing discussions between Washington and Beijing over expanding access to China’s financial markets.
 
 In February, Citigroup became the first U.S.-based bank to secure a license to act as a bond settlement agent in China’s interbank bond market, allowing its local unit to compete alongside Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA) in the country’s $9 trillion bond market.","['beijing', 'services', 'citigroup', 'markets', 'belt', 'bank', 'boost', 'china', 'lam', 'targets', 'road', 'revenue']","{'China': 12, 'Kazakhstan': 1}",,,,,

 The announcement that a U.S. delegation would be coming to what is China’s biggest diplomatic event of the year coincides with the unveiling of an important trade deal between China and the United States.
 
 The deal, the first tangible result of trade talks that began last month, will see China allow U.S imports of beef no later than July 16. By that deadline, the United States said it would issue a proposed rule to allow Chinese cooked poultry to enter U.S. markets.
 
 China will also allow increased access for American financial firms.
 
 In return, the United States said it “recognizes the importance” of the plan for a new Silk Road, known as the Belt and Road initiative, and would send a delegation to a conference on it in Beijing, delivering a symbolic boost to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign and economic policy.
 
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Pottinger, special assistant to the president and the National Security Council’s senior director for East Asia, would be coming.
 
 “We’ve said all along the Belt and Road is an open, inclusive initiative,” Geng told a daily news briefing. “We welcome all parties to participate.”
 
 The U.S. embassy in Beijing said U.S. Commerce Department official Alan Turley would be part of the delegation.
 
 Despite espousing extensive infrastructure investment across Asia, Europe and beyond, the initiative has struggled to generate much traction from major Western economies despite an aggressive diplomatic effort and promotion.
 
 Of the 29 visiting leaders attending what is formally called the Belt and Road Forum, only one - Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni - is from a G7 nation.

 The forum is seen as one of China’s competing initiatives against the Obama administration’s regional trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which did not include China.
 
 But U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the partnership in January, effectively killing the deal.
 
 “The United States has realized the importance of the Belt and Road Initiative and will send its delegates to attend the summit,” vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao said in an earlier news briefing on Friday.","['initiative', 'delegation', 'united', 'beijing', 'belt', 'trade', 'chinas', 'china', 'summit', 'send', 'states', 'road']","{'China': 10, 'United States': 6}",,,,,

 The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.
 
 What do investments in engineering companies, banks and bananas have in common? They’re all justified by China’s “One Belt, One Road” plan to boost trade and spread soft power. Yet early signs are the scheme may provide another excuse to shuffle money and favours between state companies.
 
 President Xi Jinping envisions the People’s Republic at the nexus of global trade, with a “belt” of trade routes across central and southern Asia connecting China with new markets, and a maritime channel – confusingly known as a “road” – centred on Chinese ports.
 
 China is backing its vision with hefty investment: it has set up a $40 billion Silk Road Fund and was the driving force behind the new $50 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Chinese policy banks will provide further financial muscle to build infrastructure and invest in foreign businesses from Pakistani power plants to Malaysian banana plantations.
 
 But investments in foreign countries take time and diplomatic wrangling. So in the meantime China’s new funds are likely to take the easier step of investing in state-owned enterprises. This allows them to observe the letter of the slogan while ignoring the spirit of extending China’s international financial reach.
 
 Potential recipients of state cash are therefore dutifully incorporating “One Belt, One Road” into their policies. It will likely be a neat trick to justify state-owned company expansion plans or dust off mothballed provincial projects.
 
 To date, the Silk Road Fund has invested in a power plant in Pakistan and helped fund the acquisition of Italian tyre-maker Pirelli. It also invested $300m in the Hong Kong initial public offering of power plant builder China Energy Engineering Corp, which sold 70 percent of its $1.8 billion equity issue to state-owned cornerstone investors. The Silk Road Fund also backed the IPO of China International Capital Corp, the investment banking group.
 
 Other investors have jumped on the bandwagon. A Cayman Islands-registered entity named Belt and Road Investment backed the recent IPO of Bank of Qingdao, the lender based in the coastal city famed for its beer.
 
 President Xi’s vision may eventually open up new markets for China. For now though, it will also provide financial cover for bureaucrats whose main ambition is to curry favour with their superiors.","['catchall', 'silk', 'belt', 'trade', 'investment', 'chinas', 'fund', 'china', 'provide', 'power', 'slogan', 'road', 'stateowned', 'financial']","{'China': 8, 'Cayman Islands': 1, 'Hong Kong': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Pakistan': 2}",,,,,

 Hammond’s visit, the latest installment in long-running economic talks between the two nations, it has taken on new importance for Britain as it looks to re-invent itself as a global trading nation after leaving the European Union in 2019.
 
 Meeting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Hammond said there were many opportunities to build on their strong relationship.
 
 “I was privileged earlier this year to represent the U.K. at the first Belt and Road forum and one of the things we will discuss tonight and tomorrow is the opportunity for closer collaboration in delivering the ambitions of the Belt and Road program,” he said, without elaborating.
 
 President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road initiative aims to recreate the old Silk Road with massive infrastructure projects to connect China to Europe and beyond.
 
 Li told Hammond that people in China follow developments in Britain and Europe closely.
 
 “We believe that no matter how the situation in Britain and in Europe may evolve, China will continue to hope that there will be steady and sound ground growth of Sino-British and Sino-Europe ties,” Li said.
 
 China is one of the countries with which Britain hopes to sign a free trade pact once it leaves the EU. London and Beijing have been keen to show that Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc will not affect ties.
 
 The focus on a “Golden Era” of relations, trumpeted by both sides in 2015 when then-prime minister David Cameron hosted a state visit by Xi, has cooled under Cameron’s successor Theresa May.
 
 In 2016, May caused a diplomatic spat by unexpectedly deciding to delay approval of a partly-Chinese funded nuclear power project. She later granted it, but not before drawing criticism from Beijing.
 
 Business Minister Greg Clarke will travel to Beijing too, along with a delegation including London Stock Exchange CEO Nikhil Rathi and representatives of major financial firms such as BlackRock, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank.
 
 Talks are expected to focus on a more integrated approach to financial services, new industrial partnerships and economic reform.
 
 Previous rounds of discussions have examined how to develop London as an offshore hub for trading China’s currency and closer integration of the two countries’ stock markets.
 
 Clark will hold energy-specific talks focused on clean and renewable power generation.","['beijing', 'london', 'closer', 'minister', 'talks', 'eyes', 'belt', 'cooperation', 'li', 'china', 'britain', 'hammond', 'road']",{'China': 8},,,,,

Sharma Oli and is expected to sign a deal expanding a railway link between the Himalayan nation and Tibet, officials said.
 
 Xi will be the first Chinese president to visit Nepal in 22 years and will arrive from India, where he held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Landlocked Nepal, a natural buffer between India and China, has been trying to lessen its dependence on New Delhi.
 
 The Chinese leader will meet Oli on Sunday and the two leaders are expected to sign a slew of deals, including the planned extension of the rail link from remote, mountainous Tibet to Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, officials said.
 
 The link will be part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Xi’s signature project that Nepal joined in 2017.
 
 Rajan Bhattarai, one of Oli’s top aides, said a feasibility study of the plan had been conducted by Chinese experts.
 
 “An agreement for the preparation of a detailed project report for the railway link is expected to be signed after the prime minister’s meeting with President Xi on Sunday,” Bhattarai told Reuters.
 
 The report will contain cost estimates, with financing and construction models to be decided, officials said.
 
 Nepal sees the rail link with China as an alternative to its dependence on India. New Delhi accounts for nearly two-thirds of Nepal’s trade and is the sole source of its fuel supply.
 
 A prolonged blockade of its border crossings with India in 2015 and 2016 left Nepal short of fuel and medicine for months.
 
 Asian giants India and China have both sought to woo Nepal and have poured in aid and infrastructure investment.

 HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - The People’s Republic of China turns 70 on Tuesday. President Xi Jinping has bought compliance and crushed resistance. His cowing of internal critics, however, is becoming a risk to economic resilience.
 
 China in 2019, with a $14 trillion economy, is vastly different from the impoverished wreck that emerged from civil war in 1949. The Chinese Communist Party has changed too. It has warmed to foreign trade and private property, allowed more freedoms and raised a generation of pro-growth technocrats to build infrastructure, schools and financial markets. These pragmatists convinced foreigners to plough an accumulated $1.6 trillion into a still-communist country, helping propel domestic companies up the value chain.
 
 Some officials proved a little too pragmatic, exploiting positions for personal profit. When Xi Jinping took power in 2012, he cleaned house, consolidating his personal power along the way. Economist Andy Xie estimated corruption was costing around 10% of annual GDP. Yet the purge of hundreds of thousands of officials scarred the state.
 
 Many local bureaucrats are now so risk-averse that they are hobbling stimulus efforts as growth slows. Worse, in part because salaries were not adjusted after illicit perks stopped padding pay, government jobs appeal more to ideologues than specialists. The exodus of financial regulators to the private sector, for example, was a factor in the botched response to the stock market crash of 2015. When the United States followed through on tariff threats, the Ministry of Commerce admitted it had run low on experienced negotiators.
 
 Xi has prioritised loyalty, but he has plugged the government’s ears too. Straight-talking reformists like erstwhile Finance Minister Lou Jiwei have been sidelined; the pro-market Unirule Institute of Economics was shut down this year.
 
 This tighter control expands a worrying information vacuum in Beijing and beyond. Many mainland investors had no idea why their stock indexes swooned in reaction to President Donald Trump’s trade war tweets. The leadership itself often appears ill-informed, caught off-guard by backlash against campaigns like the Belt and Road Initiative, and by massive protests in Hong Kong that are destabilising the country’s only hard-currency financial centre.
 
 As a result investors, who once believed that Beijing bureaucrats made rational business partners, are losing confidence. The regime may pay a high price.","['trillion', 'applause', 'breakingviews', 'trade', 'stock', 'xi', 'president', 'republic', 'china', 'private', '70', 'turns', 'forced', 'war', 'financial']","{'China': 4, 'Hong Kong': 2, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 A planned vote on Monday by the 15-member Security Council to renew the U.N. mission, known as UNAMA, was delayed to Tuesday to allow for more negotiations. The mission’s mandate expires on Tuesday.
 
 To pass, a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, China, France, Russia and Britain.
 
 Ahead of the postponement, diplomats said China was expected to veto a resolution - drafted by Germany and Indonesia - that did not include a reference to its global Belt and Road infrastructure project.
 
 China’s U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 
 China was then planning to propose a vote on a short draft resolution, known as a technical rollover, to allow the mission to keep operating, diplomats said. But they added it could fail to get the nine votes needed to pass because several council members were considering abstaining.
 
 Speaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she “did not know where this news had come from”.
 
 The situation in Afghanistan was at a crucial stage and China supported UNAMA - the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan - to support reconstruction there, she said.
 
 China hoped Security Council members would “jointly safeguard the important consensus reached in the past, respect each other’s concerns, continue to carry out constructive cooperation on the Afghan issue, and safeguard the unity of the Security Council”.
 
 The U.N. mission, which was established in 2002, is helping Afghanistan prepare for a Sept. 28 presidential election and is pushing for peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
 
 STANDOFF
 
 Talks between the United States and Taliban militants on a U.S. troop withdrawal fell apart this month.
 
 There are about 14,000 U.S. troops and thousands of other NATO troops in the country, 18 years after a U.S.-led coalition ousted the Taliban following the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States.
 
 The UNAMA mandate is renewed annually by the Security Council. The resolutions in 2016, 2017 and 2018 all included a reference welcoming and urging efforts, like China’s Belt and Road initiative, to facilitate trade and transit.
 
 But when it came time to extend the mandate again in March, the United States and other Western council members wanted the language removed, sparking a standoff with China.
 
 The council ended up adopting a six-month technical rollover to allow the mission to keep operating.
 
 At the time, acting U.S. Ambassador Jonathan Cohen denounced China for holding “the resolution hostage” by insisting “on making it about Chinese national political priorities rather than the people of Afghanistan”.
 
 He criticized Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative - which aims to link China by sea and land through an infrastructure network with southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa - for “known problems with corruption, debt distress, environmental damage, and lack of transparency”.
 
 At a Security Council meeting on Afghanistan last week, Cohen referred to the impasse with China.
 
 “We strongly believe this mandate is too important at this moment to have one Security Council member deny consensus for reasons having nothing to do with UNAMA,” Cohen said.
 
 Chinese U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun did not specifically mention the negotiations on the UNAMA resolution, but said China was working with Afghanistan to advance “the Belt and Road construction to actively support the Afghan rebuilding and its reintegration into the regional economic development”.","['united', 'afghan', 'resolution', 'unama', 'belt', 'mission', 'diplomats', 'standoff', 'china', 'afghanistan', 'signals', 'road', 'security', 'veto', 'council']","{'Afghanistan': 7, 'China': 14, 'Germany': 1, 'France': 1, 'Indonesia': 1, 'Oman': 1, 'United States': 5}",,,,,

 China is financing more than a quarter of the world’s coal-fired power plants being built outside of its borders in countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam and South Africa, a study found earlier this year.
 
 “It would redound to China’s everlasting credit if this policy of financing the construction of so many new coal plants in other countries could respectfully be reviewed and reconsidered,” Gore told a small crowd at China’s booth.
 
 “Perhaps the traffic light that is now showing green could blink yellow and then blink red. And decisions might be made in favor of alternative sources of energy in the way China finances development in other countries,” he said, speaking alongside China’s lead negotiator Zhao Yingmin.
 
 Responding on behalf of the Chinese delegation, He Jiankun, a Tsinghua University professor and government climate advisor, said Beijing was moving away from coal investments abroad in its massive Belt and Road programme.
 
 “Now China increasingly from a policy perspective is building a green Belt and Road and no longer encourages building coal power plants,” he told Reuters.
 
 Domestically, he said, while new coal plants were being built, others were being taken offline and China’s overall coal consumption will fall, he added.
 
 Chinese financial institutions have committed or offered funding of $35.9 billion for 102 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power now being developed outside the country, according to a report earlier this year by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a U.S.-based think-tank.
 
 The world’s biggest energy consumer had been investing heavily in alternative fuels domestically amid a drive to cut greenhouse gas emissions as well as smog choking urban areas.
 
 But now with its domestic economy slowing, even that drive to cut coal has waned with 42.9 gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity being added in the 18 months to June and another 121.3 GW under construction, a November study found.
 
 That compares with 35 GW of coal-fired power added in 2017 and 38 GW in 2016.

 The week-long China International Import Expo (CIIE) comes at a critical moment, following Chile’s announcement on Wednesday that it was withdrawing as host of an APEC summit in mid-November.
 
 The United States and China had hoped to sign the first stage of a deal to ease trade tensions at the meeting in South America. U.S. President Donald Trump said the deal would still happen, although the venue remains unclear.
 
 Critics have said CIIE, which was launched last year, is mostly symbolic, and argue that a six-day fair focused on buying foreign goods does little to address the structural issues that underpin critiques of Beijing’s trade and economic practices.
 
 But for China, which will host more than 3,000 companies and several foreign leaders at the event - including French President Emmanuel Macron - it is part of a bigger drive to cast its economy in a new light and bolster its global role.
 
 “The import expo is a very important international relations tool for China. It’s more than just saying that it’s open for business,” said Rodrigo Zeidan, an associate professor of business and finance at New York University in Shanghai.
 
 “There is this subtext that is about China’s role in the global economy.”
 
 The event dovetails with China’s signature Belt and Road initiative to invest heavily in the development of land and sea links to Central Asia and Europe, as well as efforts to deepen economic links within Asia, he said.
 
 Underscoring how important the government sees CIIE, Chinese President Xi Jinping will deliver opening remarks on Tuesday for the second year in a row.
 
 On Tuesday, China will also host a “mini-ministerial” meeting of around 30 World Trade Organization members. The meeting will discuss the multilateral trade system and WTO reform, which China is keen to promote, state media have said.
 
 “China is trying to play a more important role with the WTO, especially given the U.S. disinterest, or potential interest in leaving the WTO altogether,” said Zhu Ning, a professor of finance at Tsinghua University.
 
 “I think China is working more with multilateral organizations and bilaterally with individual countries trying to improve its own influence globally and trying to shape the global trade and financial order going forward.”
 
 The United States seeks “a fair, reciprocal, and balanced trade relationship with China”, but has no plans for “high-level government participation” in CIIE, an embassy spokesman said.
 
 “We urge Beijing to adhere to the market-based rules and norms of the international trade system. This would be good for the United States, for the world, and for the Chinese people,” he added.
 
 China says U.S. businesses will be well represented at the expo, with more American companies taking part this year than last year.
 
 Its Foreign Ministry downplayed the significance of a lack of high-level U.S. official participation.
 
 Such representatives are welcome to come but if they do not it will be “no big deal,” spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Friday. The increased participation of American companies in the expo shows that they value the Chinese market, he said.
 
 Ker Gibbs, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said that while CIIE was an opportunity for companies, concerns about intellectual property rights, market access and the lack of a level playing field “are real challenges”.
 
 “We hope that CIIE will spur substantive economic reform and opening in China,” he said.
 
 Last year, CIIE was plagued by organizational gaffes. Some $57.8 billion worth of deals were signed, according to official statistics, but it was unclear what portion of those were new or represented legitimate, actionable promises.

 Beijing will host a Belt and Road summit next week which 37 foreign leaders will attend, including some of China’s closest allies, though the United States which has been critical of the project is only sending low level representatives.
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative, as it is formally called, is a key initiative of President Xi Jinping, and envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending.
 
 But it has proved controversial in many Western capitals, particularly Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and saddle countries with unsustainable debt through nontransparent projects.
 
 The United States has been particularly critical of Italy’s decision to sign up to the plan last month, during Xi’s visit to Rome, the first for a G7 nation.
 
 Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi, the government’s top diplomat, told reporters that the Belt and Road scheme had brought real benefits to participating countries.
 
 “This partnership relationship is not a geopolitical tool, but a platform for cooperation,” he said.
 
 “You can’t put hats like ‘debt crises’ onto the head of the Belt and Road, and this is not something any participating country would recognize,” Wang added.
 
 “Of course, there is a development process for the Belt and Road. You can’t get there in one step, and it’s unavoidable it will cause some worries during its development. So we welcome all sides to come up with constructive suggestions,” he said.
 
 CLOSE ALLIES COMING
 
 The number of foreign leaders at the April 25-27 summit is up from 29 last time, mainly from China’s closest allies like Pakistan and Russia but also Italy, Switzerland and Austria.
 
 The United States will not send high-level officials, a U.S. State Department spokesman said earlier this month, citing concerns about financing practices for the initiative.
 
 Wang said there would be Americans at the summit, made up of diplomats, state-level officials, executives and academics, though he did not give details.
 
 “We welcome any country that is interested to take part. When the United States participates, or whether it participates, is up to them to decide,” he added.
 
 While the United States and China are currently working to end a bitter trade war, they have numerous other areas of disagreement, including human rights and U.S. support for self-ruled Taiwan.
 
 China on Monday condemned as “slanderous” criticism U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made of Beijing’s policies in South America last week.
 
 “The United States has no plans to send high-level officials from Washington to the Belt and Road Forum,” a U.S. Embassy in Beijing spokesman said.
 
 “We call upon all countries to ensure that their economic diplomacy initiatives adhere to internationally-accepted norms and standards, promote sustainable, inclusive development, and advance good governance and strong economic institutions.”
 
 At the first Belt and Road summit two years ago, the United States submitted a diplomatic note to China complaining about North Korea’s participation, though since then Washington and Pyongyang have sought to re-set ties, including with two summits between their leaders.

 The Indian Ocean island chain has been caught in a battle for influence between India and China, which invested millions of dollars during the rule of the pro-China former leader Abdulla Yameen as part of China’s Belt and Road plan, designed to improve its global trade reach.
 
 The ruling Maldivian Democratic Party, which won a landslide in the archipelago’s parliamentary election in April, fears the debts to China could run as high as $3 billion and risk sinking the economy.
 
 Meeting Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid in Beijing, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi said China’s cooperation with the Maldives would not be affected by the change of government, China’s foreign ministry said in a statement late on Friday.
 
 “China’s cooperation with the Maldives aims to promote the well-being of the Maldivian people, without political intentions and without seeking geopolitical interests,” the ministry cited Wang as saying.
 
 China provides what help it can to the Maldives without attaching political preconditions, and does not interfere in the its internal affairs, Wang added.
 
 “It is totally without basis to say that ‘the Maldives is mired in a Chinese debt trap’,” he said.
 
 The Chinese statement quoted Shahid as saying no country in the world had been as generous to helping the Maldives, pointing to the building of infrastructure and “provision of a large amount of aid and loans”.
 
 “In this regard, there is absolutely no so-called ‘debt trap’. To say that is complete nonsense.”
 
 China has been stung by criticism, mostly from Western countries, that it loads up poor, developing nations with unsustainable debt they have no hope of paying back, and that it is seeking to use this to leverage political influence.
 
 China says its loans are much welcomed and much needed, and points out that it provides them with no political pre-conditions and gives funds to places that Western donors ignore.","['shahid', 'debt', 'wang', 'minister', 'chinese', 'maldivian', 'political', 'foreign', 'trap', 'china', 'mired', 'maldives']","{'China': 11, 'India': 3, 'Maldives': 7}",,,,,

 Environmental group E3G, which commissioned the poll, said the results showed there was little support for investment in coal, despite China’s role as a major funder of new plants.
 
 “China should now work with governments, business and investors at the upcoming forum to make sure these demands are met,” said Nick Mabey, chief executive of E3G.
 
 The survey was released ahead of China’s second international forum on its 2013 Belt and Road initiative, which is designed to build infrastructure and encourage trade and economic cooperation along the old Silk Road route connecting China to Europe and elsewhere.
 
 According to a draft communique seen by Reuters, world leaders attending the summit will call for sustainable financing that promotes green growth.
 
 But concerns have been raised that China is using the program to export substandard polluting technologies, even as it boosts the share of renewable power at home in a bid to cut smog and climate-warming greenhouse gases.
 
 The YouGov poll of more than 6,000 people covered Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa, Turkey and Vietnam, which are among the top 10 locations for the construction of new coal-fired power plants, with many backed by Chinese developers.
 
 Over 85 percent of those surveyed said they favored investment by foreign governments, banks and companies in renewable projects, while less than a third said they favored investments in coal.
 
 More than 90 percent said solar power should be a priority. Coal-fired power was less popular than nuclear in four of the six countries.
 
 In a separate announcement on Wednesday, a coalition of Chinese environmental groups urged Beijing to draw up green guiding principles for investment in Belt and Road countries.

 Disputes in the Arctic over global warming and access to minerals broke into the open in May when U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo accused Russia of aggressive behaviour in the polar region and said China’s actions must be watched closely.
 
 “A great power play is shaping up between Russia, the United States and China, which is increasing the level of tension in the (Arctic) region,” the Defence Intelligence Service said in its annual risk assessment report.
 
 China, which defines itself as a ‘near-Arctic state’, has an ambition to gain greater access to untapped resources and faster trade through the Northern Sea Route.
 
 In 2017, Beijing included Arctic sea routes in its so-called Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to strengthen China’s ties to the rest of the world through infrastructure projects and research.
 
 China has in recent years invested heavily in Arctic research. But Danish Defence Intelligence Service chief Lars Findsen said on Friday that Chinese research expeditions in the Arctic are not just a matter of science but serve a “dual purpose.”
 
 “We have looked at Chinese research activities in the Arctic, and see that the Chinese military is showing an increasing interest in being part of that,” he said.
 
 Findsen declined to name specific research expeditions involving the Chinese military, but said examples in recent years signalled a “new development”.
 
 “It is likely that a part of China’s build-up of knowledge about the Arctic and capacity to operate in the Arctic will take place in a collaboration between civilian and military actors,” the report said.
 
 Denmark has made it a priority to maintain the Arctic as an area of international cooperation and resolve any potential issues through political negotiations between countries with Arctic territory. Greenland, a vast island straddling the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, is a self-ruling part of Denmark.
 
 But Denmark’s goal has become harder to achieve as Russia in particular is strengthening its military capabilities there, the intelligence report said.
 
 “This is an essential driving force for several other Arctic coastal states starting to strengthen their (own) regional military capabilities,” it said.
 
 The report also said a new U.S. Arctic strategy published in June this year combined with public comments from high level government and defence officials, have also contributed to heightened tension in the region.
 
 Increased U.S. interest in the Arctic became apparent in August when President Donald Trump suggested buying Greenland from Denmark, an idea quickly dismissed by the Danish and regional Greenland governments.","['research', 'military', 'arctic', 'denmark', 'chinese', 'greenland', 'science', 'chinas', 'report', 'push', 'china', 'mixing', 'russia', 'service', 'intelligence']","{'China': 7, 'Denmark': 4, 'Greenland': 4, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s Communist Party will hit its self-imposed economic targets in 2020. The government led by Xi Jinping will be able to boast of doubling incomes and real gross domestic product in the decade from 2010, while eliminating extreme poverty. That’s a laudable achievement.
 
 Even China’s harshest critics give it credit for a vast improvement in material living standards. President Hu Jintao set the target of doubling individual spending power in 2012. His successor Xi made the elimination of poverty his signature issue, leaning on officials and companies to pull 13 million people per year above the annual income threshold of 2,300 yuan ($327), in 2010 prices.
 
 Nominal disposable incomes have more than doubled already. Rural residents earned an average of 15,000 yuan in 2018, up from the 6,000 yuan they took home in 2010. City dwellers made nearly 40,000 yuan, up from 19,000 yuan. Official data shows just 1.7% of the population was below the official poverty line in 2018, down from 17% at the beginning of the period.
 
 Yet poverty is relative. Wages have risen in rural areas where 40% of the population lives, but have fallen behind urban centres. Poor provinces have absorbed heavy environmental costs from breakneck industrial growth, while weak education systems left them poorly positioned to cash in on China’s tech boom. Nor has Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative noticeably boosted growth inland. In the western Xinjiang region the poverty rate is nearly eight times the national average, state media says.
 
 As incomes doubled, the money supply tripled to deliver the other target: doubling GDP. Much flowed into silly investments now weighing down balance sheets, constraining stimulus as activity cools. That puts jobs and household consumption – which comprises around 38% of output - at risk again. Yet once-frugal Chinese families now owe the equivalent of 121% of their earnings, a survey by China’s Southwest University of Finance and Economics found - more than Americans. The country ranks 93rd on the United Nation’s 2019 happiness index, roughly where it was in 2012. It’s the most miserable country in East Asia. Having solved poverty, Xi needs to figure out why his people seems so dispirited. There’s no target for that.","['2010', 'target', 'population', 'poverty', 'miserable', 'merely', 'breakingviews', 'swaps', 'yuan', 'xi', 'chinas', 'doubling', 'rural', 'china', 'incomes', 'poor']","{'China': 5, 'Hong Kong': 1}",,,,,

 The report by the non-profit, non-partisan National Bureau of Asian Research calls for a four-part strategy to counter economic and security risks posed by China, including urgent moves to boost information-sharing and cooperation with allies. [here]
 
 It also recommended a ceasefire in the 16-month old tariff war; strengthening defensive measure to reduce U.S. vulnerabilities to Chinese surveillance or sabotage; and increased investment in U.S. innovation and technology.
 
 “None of these things are going to be easy, especially with this administration,” said Charles Boustany, a former Republican congressman from Louisiana who co-authored the report.
 
 “But Congress is begging for alternatives to tariffs. There really doesn’t appear to be a coherent, comprehensive strategy.”
 
 Democrats and Republicans broadly agree on the need to push back against China’s use of subsidies, tariffs and non-tariff barriers, its theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer, but say tariffs are not the right answer.
 
 China denies the U.S. accusations of unfair trade policies.
 
 President Donald Trump’s tariffs - which will soon cover nearly all Chinese imports - have hit consumers, industry and farmers at home, while triggering retaliatory measures from China that have been squarely directed at U.S. farmers.
 
 Trump has also imposed or threatened tariffs against U.S. allies such as Japan and the European Union, stoking uncertainty and making it difficult for those countries to find common cause with Washington, even if they share concern about Beijing’s behavior, the report said.
 
 Boustany said Washington should focus on confidence-building measures such as sharing information on China’s policies to rebuild its relations with key allies.
 
 Aaron Friedberg, a professor at Princeton University and the other author of the report, said Washington should stop antagonizing its allies and focus on China.
 
 “It doesn’t make sense. The magnitude of the challenges posed by China by far exceeds any complaints we may have with the EU, Japan or Korea about trade issues,” he said.
 
 Joining forces would allow Washington and its key allies to exert the maximum possible leverage to get Beijing to stop its market-distorting trade and industrial policies. Then, if China did not adhere to those norms and standards, it would find itself at an increasing disadvantage in the global economy.
 
 Better cooperation could also dispel the view held in some European capitals that the United States was raising concerns about Chinese products mainly to boost U.S. companies at the expense of all foreign competitors, the research group said.
 
 Working together, the United States, Europe, Japan and others could rebuild a liberal trading system that has been strained since the 1970s by the rise of non-tariff barriers, other forms of protectionism and changes in technology.
 
 Pooling resources would also allow advanced industrial countries to counter China’s growing influence in the developing world through its Belt and Road initiative.","['tariffs', 'allies', 'washington', 'chinese', 'trade', 'chinas', 'report', 'china', 'fight', 'states', 'united', 'needs']","{'China': 11, 'Japan': 3, 'United States': 3}",,,,,

 Tensions over Kashmir have risen drastically since August when New Delhi revoked the autonomy of its portion of the territory, which both India and Pakistan rule in part and claim in full.
 
 Pakistan expelled India’s ambassador and suspended bilateral trade soon after and Khan launched an international diplomacy campaign in an attempt to draw global condemnation of India’s treatment of Kashmiris.
 
 China, which also holds a thinly populated high-altitude area of Kashmir and has a longstanding dispute over the border with India, called New Delhi’s actions “unacceptable”.
 
 “The visit will be instrumental in further cementing Pakistan’s economic, investment and strategic ties with China,” said the statement from Khan’s office.
 
 “The Prime Minister will exchange views...the state of peace and security in South Asia arising from the situation in occupied Jammu & Kashmir.”
 
 India says the status of Kashmir is a domestic issue and Kashmir will economically benefit from its move.
 
 Khan’s visit will also include talks on the progress of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the $60 billion infrastructure program China launched as part of its flagship “Belt and Road” project.
 
 Some officials and observers have said momentum on CPEC projects is slowing, in part due to concerns over the size of Pakistan’s debt and struggling economy, which led Islamabad to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a $6 billion bailout package in July.
 
 In a news conference on Sunday, Pakistan’s Khusro Bakhtiar, Minister for Planning, Development and Planning, denied there had been any slowdown in CPEC projects.
 
 “(There’s) a narrative being built up that they have become slow; I reject it, it’s totally wrong,” he said.
 
 Bakhtiar also said the Beijing visit would include talks on the ML-1 railway, one CPEC project which has stalled due to questions over funding.
 
 Khan’s visit comes before the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is due to decide whether Pakistan’s efforts to clamp down on terror financing are sufficient for it to avoid being placed on a ‘black list’ of nations that includes Iran and North Korea.
 
 China is one of 39 FATF members.

 The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in an online statement lauding the Belt and Road initiative that it would provide better guidance on risks to companies investing overseas in order to prevent “vicious” competition and corruption.
 
 The initiative is aimed at building a modern-day “Silk Road”, connecting China by land and sea to Southeast, South and Central Asia, and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
 
 The state planner cited unspecified security risks for Chinese companies investing abroad.
 
 The NDRC did not give more details about how it planned to strengthen rules or why it was concerned about corruption and unhealthy competition between companies.
 
 Also on Friday, the cabinet issued new guidelines to regulate overseas investment as the government looks to support capable firms investing overseas while restricting or banning deals in certain sectors.
 
 “(We will) guide firms to fully consider national conditions and actual needs of target countries, pay attention to mutually beneficial cooperation with local governments and companies, and generate economic and social benefits,” the State Council said in a statement.
 
 Mergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies in countries linked to the Belt and Road initiative have been growing at a rapid rate, even as the government takes aim at China’s acquisitive conglomerates to restrict capital outflows.
 
 Unveiled in 2013, the Belt and Road initiative has also come with some security concerns for China. This year, militants in Pakistan, a key Belt and Road partner, killed 10 workers and two teachers from China.
 
 The largest deal in a Belt and Road country this year was a Chinese consortium’s $11.6 billion buyout of the Singapore-based Global Logistics Properties GLPL.SI.
 
 Chinese acquisitions in the 68 countries officially associated with President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign policy totalled $33 billion as of Aug. 14, surpassing the $31 billion for all of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.
 
 Lawyers and dealmakers had told Reuters that companies were enjoying a relatively smooth approval process for Belt and Road-related deals as regulators tended to classify them differently when reviewing outbound investments.
 
 China has tightened outbound capital controls and cracked down on overseas deals it sees as risky, putting pressure on acquisitive conglomerates like Anbang Insurance Group [ANBANG.UL], HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], Dalian Wanda Group and Fosun International Ltd (0656.HK).
 
 In the statement Friday, the NDRC cited projects such as a high-speed railway in Indonesia and a crude oil pipeline between southwest China and Myanmar as examples of how the initiative was advancing.
 
 Up to the end of 2016, Chinese companies had invested more than $18.5 billion to build economic and trade cooperation zones in 20 countries along the Belt and Route routes, it said.
 
 The State Council said capable firms were encouraged to invest overseas in sectors including agriculture and high-tech manufacturing, while mining, oil, and gas developments based on “prudent assessments” are also encouraged.
 
 It reiterated that investment in property, hotels, entertainment, sports club, and film industries would be restricted, as will investment projects that do not meet environmental protection or safety standards.
 
 Investment in gambling and pornography, and some core defence technologies, and those that use technology not permitted for export are forbidden, the State Council said.","['irrational', 'companies', 'state', 'curb', 'initiative', 'countries', 'belt', 'investing', 'overseas', 'china', 'planner', 'road', 'investment']","{'China': 8, 'Indonesia': 1, 'Myanmar': 1, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Singapore': 1}",,,,,

 While China gained a major victory by convincing Italy to become the first G7 nation to formally sign on to the plan last month during Xi’s visit to Rome, others in the West have been less keen to jump onboard, though many have kept an open mind.
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative, as it is formally called, is aimed at building a vast network of infrastructure connecting China to Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe and beyond, much like the ancient Silk Road.
 
 Following the first Belt and Road summit two years ago, in a luxuriously appointed convention center in hills north of Beijing, the second one is scheduled for the same location in late April. China is billing it as the country’s most important diplomatic event of the year.
 
 The country’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, said on Saturday that almost 40 foreign leaders would come, and also took a swipe at “prejudiced” critics of the program who seek to besmirch it with concerns like “debt traps”.
 
 “The Belt and Road is open, inclusive and transparent. It does not play little geopolitical games,” Yang, who runs the ruling Communist Party’s foreign affairs committee, told the official People’s Daily.
 
 The United States, locked in a bitter trade war with China, has been a particular critic of the Belt and Road, calling it an “infrastructure vanity project” when Italy signed on.
 
 Jonathan Cohen, acting permanent representative of the United States at the United Nations, last month slammed China’s attempt to get Belt and Road language into a resolution on Afghanistan, saying it had “known problems with corruption, debt distress, environmental damage, and lack of transparency”.
 
 Wu Haitao, chargé d’affaires of China’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations, said the rebuke was “contrary to the facts and fraught with prejudice”.
 
 In 2017, the United States sent White House National Security Council senior director for Asian affairs Matt Pottinger to the summit. This time, Washington said it will not dispatch high-level officials due to its concerns about the project.
 
 Lower-level staffers, possibly from the U.S. embassy in Beijing, might go to the summit to observe and take notes, sources familiar with the matter said, though a final decision has yet to be made.
 
 China says it always welcomes “like-minded countries” to take part in the project.
 
 It has not disclosed a full list of the leaders planning to attend the event. But some of Beijing’s closest friends have confirmed they will go, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.
 
 EU WARINESS
 
 The European Union, China’s largest trading partner, has also been in a bind about how to respond.
 
 Last week, Europe’s top leaders told Xi they wanted a fairer trading relationship with China, signaling an openness to engage with the project if it meant more access to the Chinese market.
 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking at the EU summit in March, grumbled about Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s decision to join the project, although she said Germany will play in active role in the Belt and Road and called for reciprocity.
 
 Conte is due to attend the summit. Rome says signing onto the Belt and Road will bring much-needed investment and boost trade and has pointed to the fact that a dozen EU countries have already signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with China, including Hungary, Poland, Greece and Portugal.
 
 SAFEGUARDING INTERESTS
 
 The EU last year proposed its own infrastructure scheme, but it has denied it is trying to counter China’s ambitions.
 
 “For China it is a question of power projection. China is corrupting what should be a level playing field by offering loans that send country debts soaring and create a culture of economic dependency on Beijing,” one EU official said.
 
 German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a Merkel confidant, is attending the summit, along with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, with Altmaier saying they wanted to “safeguard European interests in co-operation with China there”.
 
 Several EU officials said the European Commission was still looking at who to send as a replacement for Vice President Jyrki Katainen, who attended 2017’s Belt and Road summit and has cited a calendar clash with the EU-Japan summit for not being able to go this time.
 
 China has been on a push to show that the Belt and Road remains popular, despite cooling enthusiasm from governments including in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Maldives, where new administrations are wary of deals struck with China by their predecessors.
 
 The Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, who ranks below Yang, last month touted the success of the $57-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a major Belt and Road scheme.
 
 Wang said after meeting Pakistan’s foreign minister that less than 20 percent of funding for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor came from Chinese loans, with the rest made up of direct Chinese investment and free grants.
 
 The corridor focuses on the interests of ordinary people, Wang said, citing as an example women truck drivers trained to work at a coal mine connected to the project, which he described as a “touching story”.
 
 Wang told reporters at March’s annual meeting of parliament that the Belt and Road was about high quality, sustainable, green development.
 
 “As President Xi has said, the Belt and Road initiative comes from China, but the achievements belong to the world,” Wang said.","['united', 'silk', 'minister', 'eu', 'belt', 'chinese', 'ease', 'president', 'china', 'summit', 'struggles', 'looms', 'concerns', 'road', 'project']","{'Afghanistan': 1, 'China': 21, 'Germany': 1, 'Greece': 1, 'Hungary': 1, 'Italy': 2, 'Japan': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'Maldives': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Pakistan': 5, 'Poland': 1, 'Portugal': 1, 'United States': 4}",,,,,

 ZURICH (Reuters) - Siemens (SIEGn.DE) has signed more than ten cooperation agreements with Chinese companies as it seeks to benefit from deepening involvement with China’s “Belt and Road” infrastructure initiative, the German engineering group said on Wednesday.
 
 Siemens said the cooperation covers power generation, energy management, building technology and intelligent manufacturing and includes companies such as China National Chemical Engineering Group Corp, China Railway Construction Corp(International) Ltd and China Civil Engineering Construction Corp.
 
 The cooperation pact aims to target projects in countries and regions including Indonesia, the Philippines, Nigeria, Mozambique as well as South America.","['pacts', 'companies', 'building', 'construction', 'belt', 'signs', 'deepen', 'cooperation', 'mexico', 'chinas', 'push', 'ties', 'china', 'group', 'road', 'engineering', 'siemens', 'wednesdaysiemens']","{'China': 4, 'Indonesia': 1, 'Mexico': 2, 'Mozambique': 1, 'Niger': 1, 'Nigeria': 1, 'Philippines': 1}",,,,,

 But for thousands of villagers living in northern Myanmar, close to the Chinese border, there is another anniversary that no-one can celebrate. It is 10 years since they were kicked off their land for a $3.6 billion dam, an unfinished project backed by Beijing that dogs relations between the two neighbors.
 
 The Myitsone hydropower dam in Kachin state is one many multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects that form part of Xi’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative. The Chinese leader intends to discuss his grand plan for what has been described as a “21st century silk road” during his two-day visit to Myanmar.
 
 Construction of the dam was suspended in 2011 after a public outcry over evictions and expected environmental damage, which included the flooding of an area the size of Singapore, but villagers have not been allowed to return home, and Myanmar’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi has indicated it could still move ahead.
 
 “The major losses were the farmlands,” said Reverend Tu Hkawng, a member of the ethnic Kachin minority, who are mostly Christian, adding that residents had been moved into sub-standard housing provided by China and many had been forced to look for work across the border.
 
 “I would say our social structure was destroyed,” he said. “We used to help and care for each other. Such things are gone.”
 
 An open letter from dozens of Kachin civil society groups published a day ahead of Xi’s arrival called on the Chinese leader to permanently scrap the project and said broader Chinese investment in the region, including massive banana plantations, had had a “broad social and environmental impact including land problems and threats to nature and historical sites.”
 
 Chinese investment has “disrespected local traditions and values and failed to consult local people”, it said.
 
 Xi is scheduled to meet state counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and army chief Min Aung Hlaing in the capital Naypyitaw, as well as the heads of minor political parties.
 
 Protesters plan to gather outside the Chinese embassy in Yangon on Saturday to oppose the “exploitation of natural resources” in Myanmar, including the Myitsone project.
 
 Aung Soe Myint, an activist opposed to the dam, said Suu Kyi should beware of what China offers, or risk being punished at a general election expected in November.
 
 “If Aung San Suu Kyi agrees to it, it would be political suicide,” said Aung Soe Myint.
 
 UNCRITICAL RELATIONS
 
 Myanmar has had a historically fraught relationship with China, with many people suspicious of Beijing’s clout in its smaller neighbor. But relations warmed after China avoided joining the international condemnation of Myanmar over the expulsion of ethnic Rohingya Muslims in 2017.
 
 More than 730,000 Rohingya were forced to flee western Myanmar after a military crackdown the U.N has said was executed with “genocidal intent”, though the government maintains it was a legitimate counter-insurgency operation launched in response to militant attacks on security forces.
 
 China has defended Myanmar on the global stage and is viewed as the biggest obstacle to a prosecution of its leaders at an international war crimes tribunal. China is the second biggest investor in Myanmar, after Singapore.
 
 In an editorial published in Myanmar state media on Thursday, Xi said the visit was about “result-oriented Belt and Road cooperation” and move from “the conceptual stage to concrete planning and implementation” of projects like the y-shaped Myanmar-China Economic Corridor, connecting China to the Indian Ocean, which has seen slow progress.
 
 Analysts say while the Kachin state dam may feature in discussions, Myanmar is unlikely to agree to a full resumption ahead of elections coming up at the end of the year. China’s Yunnan province, the intended destination of the dam’s electricity, now has a surplus.

 Talking to reporters last week, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui said the two sides were in contact over the dam, and any co-operation would be “in line with the long-term plan of the Myanmar side”.
 
 Hla Kyaw Zaw, an analyst based in Yunnan on the Myanmar-China border, expects the two sides to work out some compromise over the stalled project.
 
 “They will find a win-win solution for the Myitsone project,” Hla Kyaw Zaw said. “It seems they (China) know and realized that here are some mistakes from their side too. They have been silent about this issue.”","['ethnic', 'disrespectful', 'groups', 'state', 'aung', 'kyi', 'chinese', 'rue', 'myanmar', 'visits', 'chinas', 'dam', 'china', 'xi', 'naypyitaw', 'investment', 'suu']","{'China': 13, 'India': 1, 'Myanmar': 23, 'Singapore': 2}",,,,,

 Chinese acquisitions in the 68 countries officially linked to President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign policy totaled $33 billion as of Monday, surpassing the $31 billion tally for all of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.
 
 Unveiled in 2013, the Belt and Road project is aimed at building a modern-day “Silk Road”, connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Central Asia, and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
 
 At a summit in May, Xi pledged $124 billion for the plan, but it has faced suspicion in Western capitals that it is intended more to assert Chinese influence than Beijing’s professed desire to spread prosperity.
 
 The surge in Chinese companies’ acquisition-linked investments in the Belt and Road corridor comes as the volume of all outbound mergers and acquisitions from China has dropped 42 percent year-on-year as of Monday, the Thomson Reuters data showed.
 
 Beijing’s move to prop up the yuan by restricting the flow of capital outside the country and clamp down on debt-fuelled acquisitions to ensure financial stability has made it tougher for buyers to win approvals for deals abroad.
 
 Regulators have tightened the screws further since June, reviewing deal agreements in minute detail and ordering a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by several big companies that have been on overseas buying sprees, including HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group and Fosun Group.
 
 The heightened regulatory scrutiny of overseas acquisitions comes after companies spent a record $220 billion in 2016 on assets overseas, buying up everything from movie studios to European football clubs.
 
 The scrutiny, however, has not impacted Chinese companies’ pursuit of targets along the Belt and Road corridor, as those investments are considered strategic for the companies as well as the Chinese economy.
 
 “People are thinking in a long-term approach when making investments along Belt and Road countries,” said Hilary Lau, a corporate and commercial lawyer and partner at the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.
 
 “The acquisitions are also policy-driven. There are funds allocated by Chinese banks and state funds for Belt and Road deals,” he said.
 
 The number of Chinese deals targeting Belt and Road countries totaled 109 this year, compared to 175 in the whole of last year and 134 in 2015, the Thomson Reuters data showed.
 
 APPROVAL PROCESS
 
 Companies enjoy a relatively smooth approval process for deals along the Belt and Road project as regulators tend to put them in a different basket when reviewing outbound investments, according to lawyers and dealmakers.
 
 “If you are doing One Belt, One Road, that becomes the first sentence in the document” to the regulators, said a senior investment advisor at a Chinese company that has acquired several overseas businesses.
 
 “It is a wise thing to point out early on,” said the advisor, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
 
 Outbound deals currently take as long as six months to be approved by Chinese regulators. However, Belt and Road investments tend to get regulatory clearance within three or four months, according to a Hong Kong-based senior M&A banker.
 
 The largest deal in a Belt and Road country so far this year was a Chinese consortium’s $11.6 billion buyout of the Singapore-based Global Logistics Properties GLPL.SI.
 
 Other top deals include the $1.8 billion purchase of an 8 percent ownership interest in an Abu Dhabi oil company by the state-owned oil giant China National Petroleum Corp, and HNA Group’s $1 billion acquisition of a logistics company, CWT Ltd, which has not yet closed.
 
 The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China’s foreign exchange regulator, said this month that domestic companies would still be encouraged to participate in Belt and Road activities.

 HNA, which has seen at least two overseas deals hit a hurdle as a result of the crackdown on transferring money, has said it plans to prioritize investments that are in industries and regions mapped out under the Belt and Road initiative.
 
 The belt and road acquisitions are predominantly in energy and infrastructure sectors, said Hilary Lau of Herbert Smith Freehills.
 
 “We’ve seen a lot of activities recently in Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. The whole Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh corridor is also hot as it’s connecting the East and West,” he said.","['companies', 'despite', 'crackdown', 'belt', 'acquisitions', 'chinese', 'deals', 'chinas', 'overseas', 'capital', 'exclusive', 'billion', 'investments', 'china', 'surge', 'outbound', 'road']","{'Bangladesh': 1, 'China': 7, 'Hong Kong': 2, 'Indonesia': 1, 'India': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'Myanmar': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Singapore': 1}",,,,,

 Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said he might sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to become a part of China’s giant infrastructure plan when Chinese President Xi Jinping visits Rome and Palermo later this month.
 
 The prospect has alarmed Italy’s main Western ally, the United States, which has urged Conte to drop the plan, calling the Chinese venture a “vanity project” that would bring no benefit to the Italian economy.
 
 The U.S. admonition has created tensions within the ruling coalition and one senior League official has called for the MOU to be put on ice. But the party leadership gave the idea conditional backing following a meeting near Milan.
 
 “If it’s about helping Italian companies invest abroad, then we are ready to talk to anyone,” League leader Matteo Salvini told reporters. “But we’re absolutely not ready to do so if it’s a question of foreign companies colonizing Italy.”
 
 Giancarlo Giorgetti, a senior League figure and cabinet undersecretary, added that Italy had “golden share” powers to protect strategic sectors such as defense, energy, transport and communications, and would not hesitate to use them.
 
 Looking to allay any such concerns, the industry ministry put out a statement saying the mooted deal did not include any accord over the creation of a 5G high-speed telecom network — a major worry for Washington, which has accused Beijing of looking to insert equipment for espionage in next-generation technology.
 
 Chinese companies have denied this.
 
 CATCH UP
 
 The Belt and Road plan, championed by Xi, aims to link China by sea and land with southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, through an infrastructure network on the lines of the old Silk Road.
 
 Washington has said China is using the initiative to bolster authoritarian regimes and export standards for technology applications that could threaten U.S. businesses and market access across the globe. It is also worried the plan might enable Beijing to extend its military influence.
 
 A number of European Union states have already signed MOUs with China, including Hungary, Greece and Poland. If Italy does likewise, it would be the first Group of Seven major industrialized nation to do so.
 
 Junior Trade Minister Michele Geraci, who has championed the China deal, said on Monday that Italy needed to convince Western allies that their fears over the planned accord were unfounded.
 
 Geraci, who spent a decade teaching in China, says Italy is simply playing economic catch up with its main trading partners, particularly regarding job creation and so-called green-field investment to build local companies from the ground up.
 
 “China has invested $5.5 billion in Britain and just $130 million in Italy,” Geraci told a foreign policy seminar at the weekend, speaking of green-field projects.
 
 “There is huge potential there that other countries are already taking advantage of,” he said.
 
 Italy went into recession at the end of 2018 for the third time in a decade and the government is anxious to find ways to boost the economy and revive the stalled construction sector.","['companies', 'minister', 'ruling', 'colonize', 'italy', 'conte', 'china', 'italian', 'business', 'xi', 'plan', 'league', 'western']","{'China': 8, 'Greece': 1, 'Hungary': 1, 'Italy': 10, 'Poland': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 BEIJING (Reuters) - Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing on Wednesday and signed several agreements in the first official visit since the two countries established diplomatic relations last month.
 
 The new diplomatic relationship is a sign of China’s growing influence in the Pacific and a setback for self-ruled, democratic Taiwan. The Solomon Islands severed ties with Taiwan when it established them with Beijing.
 
 “I am pleased to recognize the one China policy ... We are pleased to be on the right side of history and normalize relations with the People’s Republic of China,” Sogavare said ahead of a meeting with Li and a Chinese delegation.
 
 China has in recent years been expanding its influence in the Pacific to the alarm of the United States and its main regional ally, Australia.
 
 China and the Solomon Islands signed an agreement to work together on President Xi Jinping’s flagship foreign policy initiative, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as well as others on economic and education strategies.
 
 After the Solomon Islands recognized Beijing, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence declined a request from the Solomon Islands leader to meet to discuss cooperation.
 
 Taiwan President Tsai Ing Wen said last month the end of its diplomatic relations with the Solomon Islands was further evidence of Chinese efforts to meddle in Taiwan’s January elections.","['beijing', 'deals', 'chinese', 'diplomatic', 'li', 'president', 'ties', 'solomon', 'china', 'sogavare', 'sign', 'relations', 'islands']","{'Australia': 1, 'China': 6, 'Mali': 1, 'Solomon Islands': 7, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 The Belt and Road is Chinese President Xi Jinping’s landmark scheme to build infrastructure to connect China to the rest of Asia and beyond, a giant reworking of its old Silk Road.
 
 India has not signed up to the initiative as parts of one key project, the $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, run through Pakistan-administered Kashmir that India considers its own territory.
 
 Whether or not China will be able to win India round to the Belt and Road will likely be a key measure of the success of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s trip to China to meet Xi for an informal meeting on Friday and Saturday.
 
 But India’s foreign minister did not express support for Belt and Road in the communique released after foreign ministers of the China and Russia-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation met in Beijing.
 
 India, along with Pakistan, joined the group last year.
 
 All the other foreign ministers - from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - “reaffirmed support for China’s Belt and Road proposal”, the statement read.
 
 It gave no further explanation.
 
 Modi is coming to China as efforts at rapprochement gather pace following a testing year in ties between the two neighbours.
 
 The Asian giants were locked in a 73-day military stand-off in a remote, high-altitude stretch of that boundary last year. At one point, soldiers from the two sides threw stones and punches.
 
 The confrontation between the nuclear-armed powers in the Himalayas underscored Indian alarm at China’s expanding security and economic links in South Asia.
 
 Modi will come again to China in June for a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
 
 China will also have to tread carefully to avoid giving its close ally Pakistan cause for alarm.

 By Nelson Renteria
 
 SAN SALVADOR, Dec 3 (Reuters) - China will help build several major infrastructure projects in El Salvador, including a stadium and water treatment plant, the two nations said on Tuesday, signaling its growing role in the region after El Salvador cut ties with Taiwan.
 
 Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who met his counterpart Xi Jinping in China this week, said the investment represented a “gigantic, non-refundable cooperation” for the small central American nation.
 
 He did not disclose the planned investment amount.
 
 The pact provides for China to help build a large sports stadium, multi-story library and water treatment plant.
 
 China, the world’s second biggest economy, will also assist at coastal tourist sites, by building streets, parks and a water system along the beaches known as Surf City, and restaurants and shops on the Puerto de la Libertad pier.
 
 The projects offer the strongest signal yet of El Salvador’s embrace of close relations with China.
 
 El Salvador “adheres to the principle of one China, categorically rejects any act that goes against this principle and any form of ‘independence of Taiwan”, the nations said in a joint statement.
 
 El Salvador will also participate in Xi’s signature Belt and Road initiative, which envisions massive infrastructure spending to link China to the rest of Asia and beyond, they added.
 
 China is ready to import more goods from El Salvador, including sugar and coffee, its foreign ministry cited Xi as telling Bukele.
 
 El Salvador severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in August last year, after the Dominican Republic and Panama switched sides to China.
 
 China’s diplomatic push in central America has angered the United States, which said last year China was offering economic inducements to seek domination in the region.
 
 Taiwan now only has formal diplomatic ties with 15 countries, including Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in central America.
 
 Taiwan’s foreign minister said last month that China had failed to deliver promised aid worth $8.6 billion and instead “exported corruption” to nations that had switched ties to Beijing from Taipei. Beijing said this was a smear.

 The woman in the footage is dressed in traditional Pakistani clothes, sitting next to her husband who addresses her in fluent Mandarin, amplifying a message of trans-national love prevailing over differences in language, religion and culture.
 
 The videos are the latest sign of China’s growing push to build up cultural “soft power” to complement the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the $60 billion infrastructure program it has launched as part of the Asian giant’s flagship “Belt and Road” project.
 
 Over the past year, China has sent state-owned PTV and other commercial television channels a series of documentaries, dramas and other television programming for free, officials from PTV told Reuters.
 
 Experts say China has been ramping up attempts to win the hearts and minds of citizens in Belt and Road nations through language, traditional media and social media campaigns, echoing the cultural firepower previously wielded by Western nations, which have leveraged everything from language centers to Hollywood and blue jeans to burnish global influence.
 
 “We have learnt from the experience of the United States, the UK, and other Western countries - but now, it’s time for the world to understand China,” said Chen Xiang, a correspondent coordinating state-run China Radio International’s wide-ranging presence in Pakistan.
 
 “We want to tell the people the truth about China, what real China is … through radio programs, through TV and through other cultural activities we can do this.”
 
 China is boosting its Mandarin teaching through state-backed language and culture organizations called Confucius Institutes – Pakistan is home to four with two more Confucius resource centers set to open – and spreading exposure to its arts and narrative media in a bid to engage everyday Pakistanis.
 
 Earlier this year, PTV World aired its first Chinese cartoon series, titled Three Drops of Blood, following its premier at the government-funded Pakistan National Council of Arts, where the Chinese Embassy rented a large portion of the building to host a China Cultural Centre.
 
 Recent investments in TV and film follow Chinese interest in print media. Launched in 2017, Huashang, the first-ever Chinese language newspaper in Pakistan, now boasts a readership of over 60,000 a week.
 
 With around 25,000 Pakistanis learning Chinese at home and another 22,000 Pakistani students in China, there is some way to go before Mandarin challenges English in Pakistan, where the legacy of British colonial rule is everywhere.
 
 But signs of China’s presence are increasingly visible, from expatriate engineers and their families shopping in city centers to a growing number of Chinese tourists visiting the spectacular scenery of Pakistan’s rugged mountainous north. Locals report an increasing appetite to engage using shared cultural touchpoints and language – sometimes with business in mind.
 
 PAKISTANIS EMBRACING CHINA
 
 “China is interested in improving its soft power all across the world, “ said Dr Kiran Hassan, Research Associate Fellow at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, adding Pakistanis were responding with enthusiasm.
 
 “It’s an audience that is ready to receive the Chinese perspective as they feel that China is offering them an economic opportunity.”
 
 Awais Chaudhry moved from his home in the eastern city of Faisalabad to study at a Chinese language institute in Lahore for more than six months, hoping it would help his marketing job.
 
 “China is our neighbor and a large number of imports is from there, and so with that business point of view, I tried to learn the basics of this language,” he told Reuters.
 
 Everyday cultural contacts, while still limited, are expanding, although there is inevitably sometimes a darker side, notably in the periodic scandals over people-trafficking involving Pakistani girls sent to China to be married to men unable to find a wife at home.
 
 HARDER EDGE
 
 There is a harder edge to some of China’s soft power, notably in its response to criticisms of the Belt and Road initiative as a neo-colonial project, promoting environmentally damaging projects such as coal-fired power plants that benefit Chinese companies more than Pakistan.
 
 Media and think tank officials from both nations plan to set up a “Rapid Response Initiative System” to counter negative perceptions and stop “fake news” about China-Pakistan projects, some of which have garnered increasing scepticism of their economic benefits and criticism of the environmental cost.
 
 Run collaboratively by China Economic Net, a Beijing-based online news organization, and the Pakistan China Institute, a pro-Beijing Islamabad-based think tank, the system disseminates information to counter negative or “fake” views about CPEC and replace it with a message of a profitable alliance.

 “We can’t take down information, so what we do is give correct information. All media tools are used,” says Mustafa Sayed, Executive Director of the Pakistan China Institute, adding that they spread messages via news anchors, newspapers and Twitter.
 
 In August Zhao Lijian, China’s then-deputy ambassador to Pakistan, retweeted an article titled ‘CPEC is dead. Somebody tell Beijing.’
 
 “Congratulations, this report has won the title called ‘joke of the day’” he wrote in the Tweet. “The article is pure nonsense, fake news, groundless speculation.

 Tensions have escalated in recent weeks, especially after a U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by China last month as a challenge to what the U.S. Navy described as excessive Chinese territorial claims in the region.
 
 Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said Malaysia could issue protest notes if a major power were to encroach on its territory but the lack of naval and maritime enforcement assets left it at a disadvantage in the event of a conflict.
 
 Saifuddin said Malaysia’s naval assets would struggle to even match up to the Chinese Coast Guard, which he said has a near 24-hour presence around the South Luconia Shoals off the east Malaysian state of Sarawak.
 
 “Our naval ships under the Royal Malaysian Navy are smaller than the Coast Guard vessels from China,” Saifuddin told parliament during question time.
 
 “We would not want (conflict) to happen, but our assets ... need be upgraded so we are able to better manage our waters should there be a conflict between major powers in the South China Sea,” he said.
 
 China claims most of the South China Sea, through which more than $3.4 trillion worth of goods are transported annually, under its unilaterally declared “nine-dash-line”. However, it overlaps with territorial claims made by Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan.
 
 Beijing blames the United States for increasing tensions by sending warships and military planes close to islands claimed by China.
 
 Malaysia had been critical of China’s South China Sea position but has been less outspoken recently, especially after China pumped billions of dollars into infrastructure projects under its Belt and Road Initiative.
 
 Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has also said Malaysia was too small to stand up to the Asian powerhouse, even as Chinese ships surveyed its waters for oil and gas without permission.
 
 Saifuddin said Malaysia would continue to push its position on non-militarization of the South China Sea, and for the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to take a united approach in dealing with China and the United States.
 
 “The South China Sea should not become a point of conflict among countries. We are consistent on that at international fora such as ASEAN, where we raise the concept of self-restraint and non-militarization in the South China Sea,” he said.","['united', 'nonmilitarization', 'sea', 'minister', 'malaysia', 'naval', 'saifuddin', 'foreign', 'conflict', 'china', 'worst', 'south', 'ready', 'needs']","{'China': 16, 'Malaysia': 10, 'Philippines': 1, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 FILE PHOTO: Chinese President Xi Jinping leaves after a news conference at Prague Castle in Prague, Czech Republic, March 29, 2016. REUTERS/David W Cerny/File Photo
 
 The Jan. 10 letter, which was sent by China’s embassy in Prague to the Czech president’s office, suggested that Czech companies operating in mainland China, such as Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) subsidiary Skoda Auto or lender Home Credit Group, would suffer if Senate speaker Jaroslav Kubera visited the self-ruled island.
 
 Kubera died unexpectedly on Jan. 20, before his trip had been due to take place, but the letter, written in Czech, reveals how explicit Beijing was about the possible consequences if the visit had gone ahead.
 
 “Czech companies whose representatives visit Taiwan with Chairman Kubera will not be welcome in China or with the Chinese people,” the letter said.
 
 “Czech companies who have economic interests in China will have to pay for the visit to Taiwan by Chairman Kubera,” the letter added, noting, “China is the largest foreign market for many Czech companies like Skoda Auto, Home Credit Group, Klaviry Petrof and others”.
 
 The Czech president’s spokesman confirmed the letter had been received but did not comment on its content.
 
 Asked about the letter, China’s foreign ministry said it did not know where the information had come from.
 
 “I want to emphasize that China resolutely opposes a country that has established diplomatic relations with China having official exchanges with Taiwan authorities in any form. This stance has been consistent and clear,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a fax.
 
 The Foreign Ministry in Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province, criticized China’s warning to Prague.
 
 “China’s business pressure on the Czech Republic proves that ‘one belt one road’ is a predatory policy tool, bringing only counter-effects to the global business order,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said.
 
 ‘SERIOUS BREACH’
 
 As speaker of the Czech Republic’s Senate, Kubera was the country’s second-most senior official after President Milos Zeman.
 
 Zeman and Prime Minister Andrej Babis had expressed concern that Kubera’s plans to visit Taiwan would lead China to retaliate against the Central European country’s business community.
 
 The Senate’s office said Kubera had been aware of the letter and its content after receiving a copy at a regular meeting of top Czech foreign policy officials.
 
 The Chinese letter warns that Kubera’s trip would be seen as a “serious breach” of the so-called one China policy on Taiwan, under which Beijing insists it is the sole representative of China.
 
 Babis’s government, which has the main say on foreign policy, has repeatedly said it adheres to the one China policy.
 
 However, diplomatic ties cooled last year when city authorities in Prague showed support for Tibet and demanded changes to an intercity partnership agreement with Beijing over a reference to China’s policy on Taiwan.
 
 The agreement was eventually canceled, and Prague instead signed a cooperation deal with Taiwan’s Taipei, further infuriating Beijing.
 
 Another dent in bilateral relations came in December 2018 when the Czech cyber-security watchdog warned about the risks of using network technology provided by Chinese telecoms equipment makers Huawei and ZTE .
 
 A Home Credit spokesman said he had not been aware of the letter, while Skoda could not be reached immediately for comment.

 State counselor Aung San Suu Kyi greeted him with a handshake on the steps of the presidential palace after a ceremonial welcome by the president and a military marching band, on the first day of a two-day visit, Xi’s first as leader and the first of any Chinese president in 19 years.
 
 Win Myint, the president, told reporters at the palace it was a “very historic and important trip”.
 
 Analysts say Xi will seek to reinvigorate stalled infrastructure projects central to his flagship Belt and Road Initiative described as a “21st century silk road”.
 
 The two countries have had a historically fraught relationship, with many in Myanmar suspicious of the tremendous sway China holds over its smaller neighbor, but have moved closer since the expulsion of the Rohingya in 2017 was met with international condemnation.
 
 More than 730,000 Rohingya were forced to flee western Myanmar after a military crackdown the United Nations has said was executed with “genocidal intent”. China has defended the country on the global stage and is viewed as the biggest obstacle to a prosecution of its leaders at an international war crimes tribunal.
 
 China is the second biggest investor in Myanmar, behind only Singapore, data published by the World Bank shows. Myanmar’s exports to China, its largest trading partner, were worth $5.5 billion in 2018, while imports were worth $6.2 billion.
 
 Hundreds of school children and government staff lined the road from the airport on Friday, waving flags and chanting, “Chinese president!” “May his health be good!”
 
 “China always helps our country when we are in crisis or when we face natural disasters,” said Aye Aye Mu, a local teacher. “They always support us and send donations to us.”
 
 But many in Myanmar view China warily and infrastructure projects have been deeply unpopular, uprooting thousands of villagers and wreaking environmental damage.
 
 Protesters plan to gather outside the Chinese embassy in Yangon on Saturday to oppose the “exploitation of natural resources” in Myanmar, including the $3.6 billion Myitsone hydropower dam project, which was suspended in 2011 but may be restarted.
 
 In one of the capital’s most popular teashops, 34-year-old Aung Ko Latt, a businessman, said Myanmar was not equipped to evaluate Chinese projects to make sure they meet international standards and benefit local communities.
 
 “They will exploit Myanmar under the current circumstances,” he said.","['visit', 'projects', 'chinese', 'myanmar', 'palace', 'fanfare', 'chinas', 'infrastructure', 'president', 'arrives', 'china', 'hails', 'historic', 'xi', 'international', 'rohingya']","{'China': 6, 'Myanmar': 11, 'Singapore': 1}",,,,,

 The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, tasked with monitoring the national security implications of U.S.-China trade relations, has complied a report almost every year since 2002.
 
 This year it said China’s efforts, as part of its Belt and Road initiative, to fund bridges and even digital networks in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe have given its government an excuse to maintain a military presence there.
 
 The report recommended that Congress create a fund to assist countries in parts of the world where China is expanding its influence.
 
 It also warned about the threat China’s push into the next-generation 5G wireless technology poses to U.S. security and business interests.
 
 China says it wants the Belt and Road initiative, launched in 2013, to improve global transport and trade links.
 
 Many of its firms and banks are engaged in building and financing major ports, rail, highways and bridges in countries ranging from Kenya to Malaysia and Russia.
 
 The U.S. commission, however, said China was using the initiative not just to “encourage and validate authoritarian actors abroad,” but also to export standards for technology applications that could threaten U.S. businesses and market access across the globe.
 
 The commission, created by Congress in 2000, said Beijing was using the initiative to justify a military presence in some of the countries.
 
 It recommended that Congress create a fund to assist countries, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, on issues of digital connectivity, infrastructure and energy access.
 
 In Beijing on Wednesday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she had not seen the report.
 
 China cooperated with other countries based on principles of mutual respect and mutual benefit, Hua told a daily news briefing, adding that if the U.S. wanted to invest in, and help with, projects in other countries, it was welcome to do so.
 
 “But we hope that when the U.S. does this, their intentions are pure and the results are good.”
 
 TECH DOMINANCE
 
 Washington has voiced concerns over China’s growing influence. Last month, the U.S. Senate passed a measure overhauling how the federal government lends money for foreign development, in a move some analysts saw as a response to the Belt and Road initiative.
 
 The commission’s report also warned about China’s rising dominance in 5G wireless technology and the proliferation of devices connected to the internet that could be used to launch a cyber attack.
 
 “U.S. telecommunications providers’ reliance on imports from China raises serious supply chain concerns about the secure deployment of U.S. critical next generation telecommunications infrastructure,” the panel said.
 
 Concern about Chinese cyber attacks and cyber espionage has forced Chinese telecom equipment makers Huawei Technologies Corp [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) to scale back some of their business in the United States.
 
 This year President Donald Trump blocked microchip maker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) from taking over Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) amid worries it would give China the upper hand in 5G mobile communications.","['commission', 'countries', 'initiative', 'technology', 'counter', 'belt', 'chinas', 'report', 'congress', 'push', 'fund', 'create', 'china', 'security', 'road']","{'China': 13, 'Kenya': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Oman': 1, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 Macron, who will attend the fair along with other European officials including incoming EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan, would take China “at its word” that it aims to open itself up to trade, a presidential adviser said ahead of the Nov. 4-6 trip.
 
 “Since this fair is supposed to demonstrate China’s openness, well, let’s prove it with access to its agrobusiness market and progress on the EU-China deals,” the adviser added.
 
 Macron will travel with a business delegation of 30 companies ranging from blue chips to small firms. He will seek greater access in the fields of finance and aerospace as well as fewer export restrictions for French poultry.
 
 China has long been dogged by Western allegations of unfair trade practices, from forced tech transfers to protectionist market entry policy.
 
 That has led to disputes with the United States in particular, which has slapped tariffs on Chinese exports. The French adviser said Washington was right to push for better behavior from the Chinese, even if France does not necessarily support President Donald Trump’s trade moves.
 
 “The United States ask the right questions, but don’t necessarily have the right answers,” the French adviser said.
 
 The French president will be visiting China for the second time since he took office. During his last trip last year, he said Beijing's flagship ""Belt and Road"" project to develop global trade infrastructure should not be ""one-way"" here
 
 Macron has been keen for EU countries, which negotiate trade deals as a bloc, to show a united political front towards Beijing. When President Xi Jinping came to Paris in March, Macron invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel and EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker to the Elysee palace.
 
 Germany’s exports to China account for nearly half the EU total and more than four times as much as those of France.
 
 Demonstrating unity is “important, because we know how Europeans have moved to China without any co-ordination in the past, letting China think we were divided,” the adviser said.","['adviser', 'beijing', 'eu', 'right', 'trade', 'macron', 'free', 'france', 'president', 'china', 'french', 'united', 'word', 'wants']","{'China': 9, 'Germany': 1, 'France': 4, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 The 70-km (42-mile) rail link will connect Gyiron in Tibet with Nepal’s capital city of Kathmandu, making it one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in the country.
 
 A Chinese team has already conducted a preliminary study for the project, which will be part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Xi’s signature diplomatic and trade push that is attempting to recreate the old Silk Road joining China with Asia and Europe.
 
 Alongside, a proposed 28-km (17 mile) road tunnel will more than halve the distance from Kathmandu to the Chinese border, saving on time and cost.
 
 “China will now conduct a feasibility study of the rail project and help construct the tunnel way,” Rajeshor Gyawali, a spokesman for Nepal’s Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, told Reuters.
 
 Nepal has sought to increase connectivity with China since a blockade along its border with India resulted in several months of acute shortage of fuel and medicine in 2015 and 2016.
 
 “These facilities will give us alternative trade routes when we face border blockades,” Gyawali said.
 
 China and India jostle for influence over Nepal, the natural buffer between them, and are investing in infrastructure. India accounts for nearly two thirds of Nepal’s trade and is the sole supplier of fuel.
 
 Officials from both sides also signed 20 deals covering trade, water supply and traditional medicines at the end of Xi’s visit, the first by a Chinese president in 22 years.

 BEIJING (Reuters) - President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign policy plan to build a new “Silk Road” of infrastructure and trade links between China and Eurasia is not a “Chinese plot”, Xi said on Wednesday, according to state media.
 
 Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative, unveiled in 2013, aims to bolster a sprawling network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
 
 At a summit last May, Xi pledged $126 billion for the plan, but has failed to overcome suspicion in Western capitals, where officials suspect the professed desire to spread prosperity in the region is foremost an attempt to assert Chinese influence.
 
 “The Belt and Road Initiative is not a Chinese plot, as some people internationally have said,” Xi told a gathering at the annual meeting of the Chinese Boao Forum for Asia in the southern province of Hainan.
 
 “It is neither the post-World War Two Marshall Plan, nor is it a Chinese conspiracy. If you had to (call it something), it’s an ‘overt plot’,” he added, the official news agency, Xinhua, said.
 
 China has said projects along the routes of the Belt and Road will be open to investment from all, including third party nations, but some Western governments have voiced concern the deals will overwhelmingly favor Chinese companies.
 
 Visiting China in January, French President Emmanuel Macron said Belt and Road could not be “one way”.
 
 In his opening speech to the forum on Tuesday, Xi said Belt and Road pacts had been made over the last five years with more than 80 countries and international bodies.
 
 “China will not engage in geopolitical games for selfish ends, nor will it create an exclusive club, nor will it force trade deals on others from above,” he said.","['initiative', 'forum', 'asia', 'chinese', 'belt', 'president', 'china', 'xi', 'plan', 'road', 'plot']",{'China': 5},,,,,

 China has promised to show “the highest possible ambition” when reviewing its climate commitments next year, raising hopes that the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter would include stronger targets in a five-year plan from 2021.
 
 Wang, who is representing President Xi Jinping at a United Nations climate summit this week in New York, said China would aim to step up efforts to cut climate-warming greenhouse gases after next year.
 
 A “green” Belt and Road program would strengthen global cooperation on climate change, he added in a statement.
 
 Beijing has already pledged a target date of around 2030 for a peak in greenhouse gas emissions, but the Paris accord on climate change urges nations to make stronger pledges if possible.
 
 Government researchers have urged China to bring the target forward, but cautious officials have warned economic uncertainty could jeopardize even existing pledges.
 
 “In light of tough economic and geopolitical prospects, China is weighing its options on climate,” said Li Shuo, senior climate adviser with environmental group Greenpeace.
 
 “China’s statement today keeps Beijing’s intentions ambiguous, leaving plenty of wiggle room for a decision to double down on climate targets in 2020.”
 
 China will also propose 150 new initiatives to mitigate annual carbon emissions by as much as 10 billion to 12 billion tonnes through the use of natural solutions, such as reforestation, Wang added.
 
 China has championed the use of “nature-based solutions”, such as the expansion of forests, grasslands and wetlands, as well as the use of biomass energy.","['pledges', 'impetus', 'wang', 'climate', '2020', 'efforts', 'york', 'nations', 'change', 'china', 'yi', 'targets', 'united', 'greenhouse']",{'China': 9},,,,,

 Xi, the first Chinese president to visit Nepal in 22 years, arrived from India, where he held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Nepal, a natural buffer between India and China, has been trying to lessen its dependence on New Delhi.
 
 President Bidya Devi Bhandari greeted Xi on arrival at the airport ringed by hills. Thousands of people stood along the flower festooned route to welcome the Chinese leader as he drove from the airport to the hotel.
 
 The Chinese leader will meet Oli on Sunday and the two leaders are expected to witness their officials sign a slew of deals, including the planned extension of the rail link from remote, mountainous Tibet to Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, officials said.
 
 The link will be part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Xi’s signature project that Nepal joined in 2017.
 
 Rajan Bhattarai, one of Oli’s top aides, said a feasibility study of the plan had been conducted by Chinese experts.
 
 “An agreement for the preparation of a detailed project report for the railway link is expected to be signed after the prime minister’s meeting with President Xi on Sunday,” Bhattarai told Reuters.
 
 The report will contain cost estimates, with financing and construction models to be decided, officials said.
 
 Nepal sees the rail link with China as an alternative to its dependence on India. New Delhi accounts for nearly two-thirds of Nepal’s trade and is the sole source of its fuel supply.
 
 A prolonged blockade of its border crossings with India in 2015 and 2016 left Nepal short of fuel and medicine for months.
 
 Asian giants India and China have both sought to woo Nepal and have poured in aid and infrastructure investment.
 
 Beijing has helped build or upgrade highways, airports and power plants in Nepal under the Belt and Road infrastructure drive - a string of ports, railways, roads, bridges and other investments tying China to Europe via central and southern Asia.","['deal', 'visit', 'chinese', 'eyes', 'officials', 'nepal', 'link', 'president', 'china', 'prime', 'india', 'xi', 'railway']","{'China': 6, 'India': 5, 'Nepal': 12}",,,,,

 BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s April non-financial outbound direct investment (ODI) fell 71 percent from a year earlier as the government maintained a tight grip on funds leaving the country despite a high-profile outward push through the Belt and Road initiative.
 
 Outbound investment in April totaled $5.82 billion, compared with $19.98 billion a year ago, according to Reuters’ calculations based on data from the Ministry of Commerce.
 
 In the first four months of the year, ODI fell 56 percent from a year earlier to $26.36 billion, accelerating from a 48.8 percent decline in the Jan-March period, as capital controls introduced late last year slowed overseas investments by Chinese firms.
 
 China tightened its grip on moving funds out of the country late last year as the yuan plumbed more than eight-year lows. The currency has steadied so far this year, helped by the capital curbs and a retreat in the surging U.S. dollar.
 
 While Beijing says it supports legitimate overseas investment, regulators have warned they would pay close attention to “irrational” investment in property, entertainment, sports and other sectors.
 
 China’s non-financial ODI in 45 countries related to the Belt and Road initiative over the first four months of 2017 was $3.98 billion, the commerce ministry said.
 
 Belt and Road investments accounted for 15.1 percent of total ODI over January to April, up from 8.2 percent in the year-ago period, the ministry said.
 
 The Chinese leadership has positioned its Belt and Road initiative as a new engine for global growth and development, with a focus on expanding trade and investment.","['despite', 'slow', 'belt', 'period', 'months', 'chinas', 'odi', 'investments', 'push', 'billion', 'overseas', 'nonfinancial', 'outbound', 'ministry', 'road', 'investment']",{'China': 4},,,,,

 The Trump administration is seeking to counter significant Chinese influence on the continent with its new Prosper Africa trade and investment strategy and a newly established development financier, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.
 
 Analysts say the latter is Washington’s attempt at an alternative to Beijing’s sweeping Belt and Road initiative, which seeks to link China by sea and land with Southeast and Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
 
 “Countries should be wary of authoritarian regimes and their empty promises,” Pompeo said in his speech at the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa in the Ethiopian capital. “They breed corruption, dependency and instability, not prosperity, sovereignty and progress.”
 
 Pompeo’s visit to Ethiopia was also designed to demonstrate support for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s political reforms despite sporadic outbreaks of political violence, said Kjetil Tronvoll, an Ethiopia expert at Bjørknes University in Oslo.
 
 Ethiopia is due to hold an election on Aug. 29 and Abiy has promised will be free and fair in a break from decades of repression.
 
 “Abiy is pleased with whatever international attention and recognition he can get ... to bolster his political standing and give legitimacy to his upcoming electoral race,” said Tronvoll.
 
 Abiy announced on Tuesday after meeting Pompeo that the United States would provide financial assistance to Ethiopia as it pursues reforms, but neither government announced details. [L8N2AI429]
 
 Later a senior U.S. official said the U.S. had already committed $37 million to support the election, separate to the $1 billion that the United States was already providing in aid.
 
 In his speech on Wednesday, Pompeo named American companies, such as Chevron, Coca-Cola and Bechtel, as longstanding investors in the region.

 He confirmed the United States was seeking a free trade agreement with Kenya, but offered no new information about negotiations that began earlier this month in Washington.
 
 “If there’s one thing you should know about our president - my boss - you should you know that he loves deals. He wants more to happen between the United States and nations all across Africa,” Pompeo told business leaders.

 Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative, as it is formally called, envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending.
 
 But it has proved controversial in many Western capitals, particularly Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and saddle countries with unsustainable debt through nontransparent projects.
 
 The United States has been particularly critical of Italy’s decision to sign up to the plan this month, during Xi’s visit to Rome, the first for a G7 nation.
 
 Speaking to the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, Yang Jiechi, who runs the party’s foreign affairs committee, said he had noted that some in the international community believed this was a geopolitical tool and would only bring debt traps for participating countries.
 
 “This obviously shows a lack of objectivity and fair understanding of the Belt and Road initiative. It is a misunderstanding, misjudgment and is even prejudiced,” wrote Yang, a former foreign minister and ambassador to Washington.
 
 China has stressed many times that the Belt and Road is to promote joint development, he added.
 
 “The Belt and Road is open, inclusive and transparent. It does not play little geopolitical games. It does not engage in the exclusion of exclusive small circles.”
 
 Yang noted that many countries, companies and ordinary people participating in the Belt and Road project had “publicly refuted rumors” about it being a debt trap.
 
 Belt and Road projects, from their selection to their financing, go through careful risk assessments and the initiative’s principles stress sustainable development, he said.
 
 “For cooperative partners who have debt difficulties, China’s principle is to appropriately resolve this through friendly consultations, and has never pushed or forced debt” on anyone, Yang added.
 
 To date no participating country has faced a debt crisis - to the contrary many countries have been able to escape the “no development trap”, he wrote.
 
 China will hold its second Belt and Road summit in Beijing in late April.
 
 Yang said almost 40 foreign leaders would take part, but did not name them.
 
 Some of China’s closest allies have already confirmed they will come, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.","['countries', 'critics', 'silk', 'debt', 'minister', 'belt', 'development', 'diplomat', 'chinas', 'yang', 'president', 'foreign', 'participating', 'prejudiced', 'road']","{'China': 7, 'Germany': 1, 'Italy': 1, 'Cambodia': 1, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Philippines': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 The announcement comes on the back of a two-day trip to Saudi Arabia by new Prime Minister Imran Khan, who had been expected to push for financial assistance from Islamabad’s ally to help Pakistan deal with a brewing currency crisis.
 
 Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry did not reveal if Saudi Arabia would be loaning money to Pakistan to help top up its dwindling foreign currency reserves, but said he expected Saudi Arabia to invest in Pakistan in a major way.
 
 “Saudi Arabia is the first country whom we have invited as third country partner in CPEC,” Chaudhry said, referring to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the Pakistan leg of China’s vast Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
 
 Beijing has pledged $60 billion to build power stations, major highways, new and upgraded railways and higher capacity ports, to help turn Pakistan into a major overland route linking western China to the world.
 
 Chaudhry said a Saudi delegation will be coming to Pakistan in the first week of October, including the Saudi minister for finance and energy, and that should lay down a “foundation for a very big partnership”.
 
 “God willing, very big investments will be coming to Pakistan from Saudi Arabia this way,” he added.
 
 Khan’s term began with new doubt over the CPEC projects, when his commerce minister was quoted as saying Pakistan would suspend them for a year and review them. The minister later said his comments were taken out of context, and Pakistani officials reassured Beijing there would be no delay.
 
 Pakistan has in the past suggested that other countries could join CPEC, but the response has been lukewarm due to concerns that China would dominate any relationship.
 
 Saudi Arabia has a history of bailing out Pakistan financially. In 2014, six months after Pakistan obtained its last IMF bailout, Saudi Arabia loaned it $1.5 billion that the government used to strengthen its rupee currency.
 
 Ahead of Khan’s visit to Saudi Arabia speculation was rife that Islamabad will be asking for a loan to help Pakistan avoid being forced to seek another IMF bailout.","['arabia', 'invites', 'corridor', 'minister', 'cpec', 'belt', 'saudi', 'chinas', 'pakistan', 'help', 'islamabad', 'china', 'major', 'join', 'road']","{'China': 5, 'Pakistan': 18, 'Saudi Arabia': 9}",,,,,

 The attack on the Pakistani laborers took place some 20 kilometers from the emerging port city of Gwadar in Baluchistan province that forms the southern hub of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
 
 “All the laborers were shot at close range,” said senior levies official Muhammad Zareef, adding that the shooters were traveling on a motorcycle. The levies are a paramilitary force that oversees security in Baluchistan where police jurisdiction is limited to major urban centers.
 
 Gwadar’s deep-water port is the exit point for a planned route from China’s far-western Xinjiang region to the Arabian Sea.
 
 Nadeem Javaid, who advises Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s government and works closely on the CPEC program, told Reuters earlier in the week that the Gwadar-Xinjiang corridor should be operational from June next year.
 
 He said Pakistan expects up to 4 percent of global trade to pass through it by 2020.
 
 Baluchistan, however, has long faced security concerns. Separatist militants in the province have waged a campaign against the central government for decades, demanding a greater share of the gas-rich region’s resources.
 
 Security officials have said previously that militants trying to disrupt construction on the “economic corridor” have killed 44 workers since 2014, all of whom were Pakistani.
 
 Pakistan’s military created an army division in 2015, believed to number more than 10,000 troops, specifically to protect CPEC projects and Chinese workers.
 
 The men killed and wounded on Saturday had been working for the provincial government at two separate construction sites on three kilometers apart along the same road. Two laborers wounded in the shootings were taken to hospital where one of them died from his injuries, Zareef said.
 
 The roads the laborers were working on are not specific CPEC-funded projects, but they are part of a network of connecting roads that are part of the corridor.
 
 No group has admitted responsibility for the shootings but past attacks in the region have been carried out by separatists who view construction projects as a means to take over their land.
 
 The shootings come a day after a suicide bomber targetting a Pakistani senator killed 26 people and injured 40, Baluchistan Home Minister Sarfraz Bugti said.

 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the region was a natural fit for the initiative, which China has leveraged to deepen economic and financial cooperation with developing nations.
 
 “China will always stay committed to the path of peaceful development and the win-win strategy of opening up and stands ready to share development dividends with all countries,” Wang said at a meeting between China and 33 members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).
 
 Representatives from China and CELAC signed a broad agreement to expand ties in the second time China has met with CELAC - a bloc formed in Venezuela in 2011 that does not include the United States or Canada.
 
 Though it had few specific details, the agreement is part of an evolving and more aggressive Chinese foreign policy in Latin America as the United States, under President Donald Trump, has taken a more protectionist stance.
 
 The “One Belt, One Road” initiative, proposed in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping, promotes expanding links between Asia, Africa and Europe, with billions of dollars in infrastructure investment.
 
 Wang emphasized projects to improve connectivity between land and sea, and cited the need to jointly build “logistic, electricity and information pathways.”
 
 The so-called Santiago declaration, signed by China and CELAC delegates, also calls for bolstering trade and taking action on climate change.
 
 Chile Foreign Minister Heraldo Munoz, who has criticized Trump in the past, said the agreement marked an “historic” new era of dialogue between the region and China.
 
 “China said something that is very important, that it wants to be our must trustworthy partner in Latin America and the Caribbean and we greatly value that,” said Munoz. “This meeting represents a categoric repudiation of protectionism and unilateralism.”
 
 China has sought a bigger role overseas since Trump was elected, presenting its Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade agreement as an alternative to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the United States has abandoned.
 
 The country is already testing U.S. dominance in Latin America, offering the region $250 billion in investment over the next decade. It is the top trading partner of many countries in the region, including Brazil, Chile and Argentina.
 
 Still, Wang played down the idea of a race for influence.
 
 “It has nothing to do with geopolitical competition. It follows the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration,” Wang said in his remarks. “It is nothing like a zero sum game.”
 
 In recent years, Chinese companies have moved away from merely buying Latin American raw materials and are diversifying into sectors such as auto manufacturing, e-commerce and even technology businesses such as car-hailing services.
 
 “Our relations with China are very broad, this (CELAC) is one more pathway for Brazil to work with China.

 BEIJING (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Thursday China’s Belt and Road initiative is showing signs of progress but warned of potential debt risks for partner countries involved in joint projects.
 
 One challenge is to ensure that Belt and Road only travels where it is needed, and the second is to focus on sound fiscal policies, Lagarde said in prepared comments in a speech at a Belt and Road conference in Beijing on Thursday.
 
 “Fortunately, we know that China’s leadership is aware of these potential risks - as well as the proven strategies that can help address the challenges,” Lagarde said.
 
 President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative, unveiled in 2013, aims at building a modern-day Silk Road connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa. China has pledged $126 billion for the ambitious plan.
 
 In his opening speech to the annual Boao Forum on Tuesday - Asia’s equivalent of Davos - Xi said Belt and Road pacts had been made over the last five years with more than 80 countries and international bodies.
 
 Lagarde said the initiative can provide much needed infrastructure financing to partner countries, but should not be considered “a free lunch” by those nations.
 
 Belt and Road ventures can lead to a “problematic” increase in debt, potentially restricting other spending as debt service obligations rise, which could create balance of payment challenges.
 
 In countries where public debt is already high, careful management of financing terms is critical, in order to protect China and partner governments from entering into pacts that will cause financial difficulties in the future, Lagarde warned.","['initiative', 'countries', 'debt', 'warns', 'speech', 'belt', 'imf', 'progressing', 'risks', 'china', 'lagarde', 'partner', 'international', 'road']","{'China': 6, 'Hong Kong': 2}",,,,,

 Finding a more hospitable reception on eastern ground than in western Europe in recent years, China had been keen to take advantage of a Czech hunger to foster ties, led by President Milos Zeman, who has curried political favor with Beijing since taking office in 2013.
 
 From the Czech perspective, the relationship was aimed at drawing Chinese investment into the nation of 10.7 million and opening the door for Czech companies to do business in the world’s second-largest economy.
 
 But a series of diplomatic spats since the start of the year has frayed relations, and highlighted the limited returns the Czechs have received for Zeman’s goodwill.
 
 “It must be a big surprise for the Chinese,” said Vaclav Kopecky, a China expert at Prague’s Association for International Affairs. “They expected... they wouldn’t have any problems. It turned quickly in a very different direction.”
 
 The Czechs had kept Communist-run China at arm’s length following the 1989 Velvet Revolution that propelled Vaclav Havel - a personal friend of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Chinese-ruled Tibet - into office.
 
 That changed under Zeman. In 2015, he attended a military parade in Beijing to mark the end of World War Two, the only Western leader to do so, and he has visited China five times, more than neighboring Germany.
 
 He also took the Czech Republic’s richest man, billionaire Petr Kellner, to a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2014. Kellner’s Home Credit has become one of the biggest consumer lenders in China.
 
 These better relations, analysts say, aligned with China’s global Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aimed at linking trading networks to Beijing, and a series of “16+1” economic summits to whip up Chinese-led investment into central and eastern Europe.

 But the burgeoning friendship took a hit with the Czech cyber security watchdog’s December warning - the first explicit one in Europe - that infrastructure operators should guard against security threats from equipment made by Chinese telecom suppliers Huawei and ZTE.
 
 Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib’s refusal to eject a Taiwanese diplomat from a conference at the demand of a Chinese official, and his decision to fly the Tibetan flag at City Hall to highlight human rights issues, further fractured the relationship.
 
 “We want to have an apolitical relationship with partner cities, based on mutual cultural exchange,” Hrib, who spent two months in Taiwanese capital Taipei as a medical student, told Reuters.
 
 Those cultural ties have come under strain, however, with China cancelling tours planned by at least two Czech orchestras in the last two months.
 
 While a foreign ministry spokesman warned in July that the Prague mayor’s actions could harm relations, the Chinese foreign ministry assured Reuters on Friday it was “willing to work hard with the Czech side to continue to strengthen bilateral cooperation”.
 
 But overall, Chinese investment has failed to deliver jobs or the flow of money into the country envisioned when President Xi visited Prague in 2016.
 
 Up-and-coming Chinese conglomerate CEFC China Energy led the Chinese investment charge in the Czech Republic, splashing out over $1 billion on Czech company stakes. Zeman appointed its chairman Ye Jianming as his largely symbolic economic adviser.
 
 CEFC, which opened its European headquarters in Prague in 2015, took holdings in high-profile firms including J&T Financial Group, the Lobkowicz breweries, Czech soccer team Slavia Prague, and its largest airline Smartwings.
 
 But in 2017, its chief lobbyist was arrested in the United States on bribery and money-laundering charges. The following year its founder Ye was detained and the firm imploded, with Chinese state-owned investor CITIC taking over its Czech interests.

 According to the Czech central bank, foreign direct investment from China, which reached 713 million euros ($795 million) in 2015-2016, turned negative to the tune of 642 million euros in 2017 and 2018.
 
 “It wasn’t so much about business and investments,” said Kamila Hladikova, a China expert at Palacky University in Oloumoc. “It was more about finding political support for China in the European Union.”

 A Chinese former Huawei executive was arrested in Poland in January on spying allegations. He has said he is innocent in the case.
 
 And Polish President Andrzej Duda told Reuters last month that he was opposed to investment by Beijing in strategic infrastructure, including seaports and airports.
 
 Nonetheless, the minister said he welcomed investment.
 
 “We are also open to Chinese investments, especially greenfields, in the manufacturing and innovative sectors,” said Jacek Czaputowicz, during a visit to Warsaw by the Chinese government’s top diplomat State Councillor Wang Yi.
 
 The meeting took place as part of the second session of the China-Poland Intergovernmental Cooperation Committee and is part of Wang’s week-long visit through Eastern Europe, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
 
 Wang will travel to Slovakia and Hungary later this week.
 
 China is looking to reinvigorate its Belt and Road initiative, a push to grow trade with European countries over ancient Silk Road routes, in an effort to build trust in the region and maintain economic ties.
 
 Wang called for Poland and China to strengthen their coordination in a number of issues, including taking greater advantage of the Silk Road transport network.
 
 Rail services between Poland and China have grown in recent years, but congestion is an ongoing issue as cargo shipments have increased.
 
 Wang also pushed for “more fruitful” talks as part of the 17+1 format, which is designed to build cooperation among Eastern European and Western Balkan countries to facilitate Chinese investment in the region.
 
 Czaputowicz said Poland and other European countries should seek to even out trade imbalances with China.
 
 “This asymmetry, which Poland sees applies to most European Union member states, together we want to look for an agreement to balance this out,” he said.","['countries', 'state', 'european', 'minister', 'chinese', 'foreign', 'china', 'poland', 'open', 'road', 'investment']","{'China': 6, 'Hungary': 1, 'Poland': 7, 'Slovakia': 1}",,,,,

 XCMG’s foreign venture piggybacks on China’s bold scheme to extend its global influence through financing infrastructure projects in 65 nations that are home to two-thirds of humanity, and at the same time win new markets for companies weighed down by profit-crushing overcapacity at home.
 
 “This is China’s grand strategy,” said Hanson Liu, assistant president at Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, which aims to grow overseas income from 15 percent of total revenue in 2014 to more than 30 percent in the next five years.
 
 “It’s like how a person in a village has gotten rich and wants to fix roads, build power points, street lamps for the neighborhood.”
 
 Stretching from Hungary to Indonesia, Beijing estimates its much-hyped “One Belt, One Road” initiative will add a $2.5 trillion to China’s trade in the next decade, more than the value of its exports in 2013 - when it was the world’s top exporter.
 
 While it is too early to assess whether that lofty goal will be realized, the drive offshore is already proving a boon for firms like XCMG, whose listed unit, XCMG Construction Machinery (000425.SZ), has posted three years of declining sales.
 
 “Our company, from top to bottom, is focused on this,” said Liu in an interview at XCMG’s campus in Xuzhou, an industrial city in coastal Jiangsu province where the government-owned firm, one of China’s biggest heavy machinery makers, is the largest employer.
 
 CRIPPLING OVERCAPACITY
 
 After years of breakneck growth, the extent of China’s overcapacity problem is becoming clear as waning domestic demand and efforts to re-tool the economy slows growth to a pace dubbed by President Xi Jinping as the “new normal”.
 
 That has exposed supply gluts that are especially glaring in the steel, coal and cement sectors, where factories have the capacity to produce up to 30 percent more than current demand, official data showed.
 
 “One Belt, One Road” - the name comes from abbreviating the two planks of the scheme, the “Silk Road Economic Belt” and the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road” - aims to carve out new markets for goods that China makes too much of.
 
 There is evidence, from companies and data, that some effect is already being felt.
 
 Auditing firm PWC estimates that more than $250 billion worth of projects, from railways to power plants, have been contracted since “One Belt, One Road” was announced in 2013.
 
 Buoyed with a $50 billion credit line from the Bank of China for such projects, China’s largest cement maker, Anhui Conch 6000585.SS, is building at least six cement plants in Indonesia, Vietnam and Laos, according to its website.
 
 Steel firms have also said that they are looking to ramp up foreign acquisitions to move capacity to regions such as Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.
 
 In Shijiazhuang, the capital city of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing and is China’s biggest steel producer, steel exports spiked almost 50 percent to 36.5 billion yuan in the first seven months this year.
 
 The number of Chinese workers employed abroad by Chinese firms shot up by 18 percent to 1 million last year, having crept up by just 4 percent in 2013, commerce ministry data showed.
 
 FANTASY ROAD?
 
 But while firms like XCMG, which were already active overseas, are finding “One Belt, One Road” hits a sweet spot, others are struggling to gain a foothold.
 
 Eight steel mills in Hebei who spoke to Reuters said the scheme was not increasing demand enough to solve their biggest problem, low prices caused by excess supply.
 
 “There has been a little impact from ‘One Belt, One Road’, but it is not evident,” said a manager at one steel mill. “The market involved is too big, and now it’s more just a concept.”
 
 The infrastructure drive also risks running counter to another of Beijing’s policy goals, reforming China’s state-run giants - the very firms expected to win the bulk of “One Belt, One Road” deals struck between governments, according to a manager at another steel mill in Hebei.
 
 Local brokerages estimate that up to 1.5 trillion yuan ($235 billion) in state funding has been committed to the initiative so far in investments, grants and loans, some of which will be dispersed through Beijing’s new policy lender, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

 That’s about a 20th of the stimulus spending unleashed by Beijing in response to the global financial crisis, said Brian Jackson, a senior economist at IHS, adding it was “a bit of fantasy” to believe the scheme could be a panacea for China’s deep structural problems of overcapacity - created in part by that earlier splurge.
 
 Still, executives like Zhou Junjia, a sales manager with Baifeng Iron and Steel Corporation, say any kind of help is welcome as they look to break out of their crowded home market.

 Only 5 percent of 220 respondents in the monthly Reuters Corporate Survey said they would participate in the Chinese project, which aims to build infrastructure and trade links between China, central Asia, Europe and beyond.
 
 Instead, they thought a free trade agreement (FTA) between Japan and the United States, proceeding with the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) without the United States or economic cooperation with Russia, among others, represented better business opportunities.
 
 “Japanese businesses basically have no clear idea about the ‘Belt and Road’ projects,” said Toru Nishihama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, who reviewed the survey results.
 
 “Will any projects pay? Can Japanese firms expect a level playing field when they compete with Chinese state-owned enterprises?” he asked. “A lot of questions remain unanswered. Under such circumstances, companies have no choice but to wait and see.”
 
 The survey results underscore scepticism from elsewhere about the Chinese initiative, seen by some critics as an attempt to promote Chinese influence overseas.
 
 Some Japanese and Western officials have expressed concern about transparency and access for foreign companies to the “Belt and Road” projects.
 
 Last weekend, Chinese President Xi Jinping gathered with 29 other heads of state to promote the modern-day Silk Road and they agreed to build an open economy and ensure free and inclusive trade under the initiative.
 
 Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, did not attend the summit. Instead, the ruling party’s No. 2 official, Toshihiro Nikai, represented Japan.
 
 The survey, conducted monthly for Reuters by Nikkei Research, polled 527 big and mid-sized businesses between May 9 and May 19. Around 220 firms, which replied on condition of anonymity, responded.
 
 About a third of Japanese firms believed a bilateral free trade agreement with the United States would boost their business opportunities, the survey found.
 
 A quarter picked the TPP, an 11-nation free-trade zone, despite the withdrawal of the United States. The survey showed 14 percent opted for Russian-Japanese economic cooperation, while just 6 percent saw opportunities in China-led infrastructure investment.

 Australia, already a major supplier of commodities to China, is set to boost exports under a free trade deal signed last year. Asciano, the country’s largest ports and rail operator, fits with Beijing’s ambition to expand transportation linkages across a region it sees key to its economic growth.
 
 “This is part of a process where China does want to control its logistics chains,” said Harry Theochari, London-based global head of transport at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright.
 
 “If you are a big emerging nation that’s very heavily reliant on raw materials from other countries ... you’d want to have as much control over the transporting of those fundamental raw materials as you possibly can.”
 
 China Investment Corp (CIC) [CIC.UL], the country’s $747 billion sovereign wealth fund, is part of a consortium headed by cargo handler Qube Holdings Ltd (QUB.AX) offering A$9 billion ($6.4 billion) for Asciano. Under the deal, which has been recommended by Asciano’s board, CIC would take a stake in both Asciano’s ports and rail operations.
 
 A potential alternative proposal being discussed involving Qube teaming up with rival Canadian bidder Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) would leave CIC owning the railways, but not the ports, which Australia views as strategic assets that should remain in local hands.
 
 A spokeswoman said CIC was working on its bid with the Qube consortium and declined to comment further.
 
 CHINA DEALS
 
 Beijing, through the country’s firms, has been snapping up assets as part of the One Belt One Road project launched in 2013, undertaking a record 19 global infrastructure deals worth $6.8 billion in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.
 
 The initiative envisions building a network of land, sea and air routes that will open new trade links and markets for Chinese firms as the domestic economy slows.
 
 CIC, one of the sponsors of the $40 billion Silk Road Fund, has been active, but other Chinese companies are also involved.
 
 CIC holds a 10 percent stake in London’s Heathrow Airport and a 9 percent stake in the company behind the UK’s largest water and sewage company. In the United States, CIC’s investments include a 17 percent stake in power company AES.
 
 China Merchants Holdings (0144.HK) owns stakes in the ports of Morocco, Djibouti and France while Cosco Pacific has interests in terminals at the Suez Canal and Belgium’s Antwerp.
 
 “I think it is quite a smart move by them and it plays into the One Belt, One Road project because it means they are not just recreating the Silk Route but also owning the Silk Route,” said a Sydney-based M&A lawyer who advises on investments by Chinese companies into Australia.
 
 POLITICAL SENSITIVITIES
 
 The China Australia Free Trade Agreement is set to help boost investment, with in-bound private Chinese proposals below A$1.08 billion no longer requiring Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval.
 
 But political sensitivities remain around investments in areas such as agriculture and ports.
 
 The sale of Darwin Port, used by a deployment of U.S. Marines as well as the terminus for a critical underwater data cable, to China’s Landbridge Group, sparked a rebuke from Washington last year.
 
 People familiar with the Asciano deal say the new proposal is being designed to alleviate some of those regulatory concerns as the critical port assets would remain with the Australian and Canadian companies.
 
 M&A lawyers and bankers said Chinese state-owned funds and enterprises are also buying access to best practices via deals like the Asciano bid.
 
 They are keen on engineering and infrastructure deals to replicate technology and know how back in China, ANZ Bank said in a December report titled ‘What else is China buying in Australia?’
 
 “I think we’ll see them doing lots of investments into freight infrastructure, into agriculture,” said the Sydney-based M&A lawyer, who declined to be identified because she was not authorized to talk to the media. “Also, I wouldn’t be surprised if they start moving into healthcare, if they’re not already and then technology. All of that is going to be of assistance to them in the building of their economy.”

 Its perimeter walls are adorned with pictures of China’s president Xi Jinping and prime minister Li Keqiang, along with Sri Lankan leaders hailing the $67 million gift from Beijing.
 
 The hospital, specializing in kidney-related diseases, is helping China gain popular support in a country where its mega-projects have added to rising debt and raised concerns about excessive economic and political leverage.
 
 Water plants and a Chinese radio station promoting its economic and social programs are part of the campaign to win over doubters.
 
 China has invested an estimated $11 billion in Sri Lanka, around $8 billion in the form of loans related to Xi’s signature “Belt and Road Initiative” designed to boost trade and transport links across Asia.Chinese firms, employing thousands of local workers, have built a giant port and plan to construct power stations and expressways as well.
 
 But the terms of some of those projects have drawn criticism from politicians in Sri Lanka and overseas and led to policy reversals that have stalled China’s ambitions on the Indian Ocean island.
 
 “We ... expect our companies to help the Sri Lankan people with donations and corporate social responsibility work,” China’s ambassador to Sri Lanka, Cheng Xueyuan, said last month after inviting local journalists on a tour of the big Chinese investment projects on the island.
 
 The charm offensive may pay dividends.
 
 FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES
 
 This month’s presidential election, won by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, puts Beijing back in the driving seat in Sri Lanka.
 
 Gotabaya’s brother, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, courted China in the aftermath of the 26-year civil war against Tamil separatists that ended in 2009.
 
 Much of the world shunned Sri Lanka, accusing the Rajapaksas of widespread human rights violations during the conflict - allegations which they deny.
 
 China seized the opportunity to develop a vital staging post to much of Asia, Africa and beyond.
 
 Ties soured in 2015 with the election of Maithripala Sirisena as president. Wary of growing Chinese influence and mounting debt, he suspended all Chinese investment projects, citing allegations of corruption and overpricing.
 
 Sirisena eventually allowed projects to resume the following year, although he demanded changes to some terms.
 
 At his inauguration on Monday, Rajapaksa said Sri Lanka didn’t want to be drawn into a regional quest for influence. China’s expansion has come at the expense of India, traditionally Sri Lanka’s economic and diplomatic champion.
 
 “We want to remain neutral in our foreign relations and stay out of any conflicts amongst the world powers.”
 
 But shortly before his election, adviser Palitha Kohona told reporters that Rajapaksa would “restore the relationship (with China) to where it was.
 
 “I suppose the thinking was if we upset China, the West would come to us with endless bags of gold ... But the bags of gold never materialized.”
 
 HEARTS AND MINDS
 
 At Polonarruwa, where the kidney hospital is due to open early next year, families say their struggle to get treatment should ease once they have an alternative to over-stretched local hospitals.
 
 “It is really a good project because of the number of people who are suffering in this area. At the moment, we are struggling for routine checkups and dialysis,” said Lakmal Prasad, 27, a former state employee who’s already had a kidney transplant.
 
 China has also completed two water facilities in a parched part of the island, while a third, the biggest, is nearing completion and will supply clean drinking water to villages in the Puttalam area.
 
 But China’s biggest interest lies in mega-projects. The new southern port of Hambantota, near one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, cost $1.4 billion and kicked off a major post-war construction boom.
 
 It also raised fears of a “debt trap”. When Sri Lanka was unable to pay back the loan on the port, it was forced to hand over control to China on a 99-year lease in 2017.
 
 Ambassador Cheng said China’s construction spree had created as many as 100,000 jobs across the island of 22 million people and there were more opportunities opening up.
 
 To help spread the message, a Chinese state-run radio station broadcasts reports about Chinese-backed economic and social programs in Sri Lanka in the local Sinhalese language.
 
 It also offers lessons in Chinese language to help the growing number of Sri Lankans working with Chinese, from grocers to bank managers.
 
 Last week, it featured a story about a Sri Lankan man who started working with Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei in Sri Lanka a few years ago and the company moved him to Shanghai.
 
 “NO ONE STOPPING THEM”
 
 The next big-ticket projects that China wants to develop include a $1 billion central highway connecting the capital Colombo with the central Kandy district, a 15,000-hectare investment zone in Hambantota and oil refineries.
 
 China Harbour Engineering Company is already building a $1.4 billion port city next to Colombo port that is designed to be a financial center with hotels, marinas and even a motor racing track on land reclaimed from the sea.
 
 “Their focus has been unrelenting; even over the last few years their projects have all gone through. There’s no one stopping them, in the end,” said an Asian diplomat. “But they are also doing a lot more of soft-power diplomacy.”
 
 To explain the sheer scale of the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing has taken Sri Lankan politicians, journalists and local residents on tours to China.

 The world’s biggest coal consumer is expected to see total consumption fall 18% from 2018 to 2035, and by 39% from 2018 to 2050, the CNPC Economics and Technology Research Institute, run by the state-owned China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), forecast in a report on Thursday.
 
 Cutting coal consumption and replacing it with cleaner energy like natural gas and renewables has been a key part of China’s energy strategy, but it has continued to approve new mines and coal-fired power plants and support new projects overseas.
 
 Though the share of coal in the country’s total energy mix fell to 59% last year from 68.5% in 2012, overall consumption in 2018 rose 3% from a year earlier to 3.82 billion tonnes, official data showed.
 
 However, the CNPC researchers said they expected the total share of coal to drop to 40.5% by 2035 as renewable, nuclear and natural gas capacity continues to increase rapidly.
 
 “With coal demand in China falling gradually, world coal consumption is forecast to reach a peak within 10 years. Meanwhile, China’s coal demand, currently accounting for half of the world’s total, will decline to around 35% by 2050,” the report said.
 
 Li Ruifeng, vice director of the China Energy Technology and Economics Research Institute, a think tank run by the China Energy Group, China’s biggest coal producer, said coal would remain China’s major fuel over the next 15 years, with smaller mines replaced by bigger and more efficient collieries in the west.
 
 That would force utilities on China’s east coast to turn to foreign markets to guarantee supplies, with imports set to remain at around 200 million tonnes per year in the coming years “if there is no significant trade barrier”, he said.
 
 China, the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has promised to show “the highest possible ambition” when it renews its climate pledges next year, and its energy policies have come under increasing scrutiny ahead of a major United Nations climate change conference in New York in September.
 
 Though it is unclear what new pledges Beijing will make, special climate envoy Luis de Alba told Reuters on Tuesday that the UN had received positive responses from China and India when it comes to ending investment in coal at home and in the “Belt and Road” region.
 
 “Certainly there is a transition that needs to be taken into account.

 Leaders from 29 nations will gather in Beijing this weekend for China’s ambitious new Silk Road initiative that aims to develop economic links between Asia, Africa and Europe. Chinese investment could reach up to $130 billion annually over the next five years.
 
 A provincial official told a group of Chinese reporters after a press briefing that they should not report on China’s investment in countries along the Belt and Road routes, an instruction that is different from past practices, due to the sensitivity of the matter.
 
 “You reporters should focus on the theme of developing together, not what we (China) do with certain countries, because that could make other countries uncomfortable,” said the official from the eastern province of Fujian.
 
 China has long used references to countries along the Belt and Road routes in its official communiques about the initiative.
 
 Chinese media coverage of the two-day Belt and Road Forum, due to kick off on Sunday, has been relentlessly upbeat. China has also rejected suggestions that the new Silk Road is about Beijing trying to dominate the world and mould it to its liking, saying it is good for all and anyone can join.
 
 Keeping the rhetoric on an initiative that is open to all nations, some officials at the Fujian press conference denied that there were just 65 countries under the Belt and Road initiative, saying there was no such specific number.
 
 “What I can tell you is that we have repeatedly said the Belt and Road is an open and inclusive proposal,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Friday.
 
 “The Belt and Road does not have this concept of members. Anyone can join it.”
 
 Even countries not situated on the Silk Road - old or new - have been welcome to join the initiative. The leaders of Chile and Argentina will be attending the summit, as well as representatives from the United States.
 
 President Xi Jinping first proposed the Belt and Road initiative in 2013. Since then, he has used it to help portray China as an open economy, distinct from a rising wave of global protectionism.
 
 The Belt and Road initiative should not just be a “China solution” for the world, a Chinese think tank said on Wednesday.
 
 “Belt and Road when it first started was a China solution. Afterwards it became that all solutions from any country are fine,” said Wang Huiyao, head of the Centre for China and Globalization.

 While Tokayev mentioned no names, his order could mean that he is targeting former and current members of his patron and predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev’s inner circle - challenging the widespread notion that the president is only No.2 in the Kazakh political hierarchy.
 
 Tokayev’s criticism could also hurt the image of Beijing’s Belt and Road infrastructure development initiative, of which the troubled project was part.
 
 Kazakhstan signed deals with several Chinese companies and the state-owned China Development Bank in 2015 to finance and carry out a light rail transit (LRT) project in Astana, which has since been renamed Nur-Sultan.
 
 The 22-km (14 miles) network was originally due to be built in time to serve visitors to the 2017 Expo exhibition, for which Kazakhstan built a whole new area in the capital.
 
 But the project lagged behind schedule and was plagued with financial difficulties such as having a large part of its cash - more than $200 million - frozen in a local bank that went bust.
 
 Last spring, construction was put on hold altogether as the city government and the Chinese bank could not agree the terms of the next loan tranche.
 
 At a meeting with city government officials on Tuesday, Tokayev said the project should have never been given a green light in the first place.
 
 “This is a very questionable project...economically incomprehensible” he said. “I do not understand how it could have been launched.”
 
 Because of large costs and heavy penalties for pulling out of the deal, Kazakhstan will have to complete the project, Tokayev said, but those behind it must be held accountable.
 
 “I would also like to ask the anti-corruption agency to step up the investigation, it should not be superficial, simply noting that certain people have fled abroad...and overlooking (the roles) of others,” he said.
 
 Tokayev’s comments appeared to refer to Talgat Ardan, a former Astana LRT chief executive who was put on the wanted list in July on embezzlement charges, and some of the former mayors of the capital.
 
 The LRT project was launched in 2011 under Mayor Imangali Tasmagambetov but was subsequently shelved due to high costs. The next mayor, Adilbek Zhaksybekov, revived the idea and oversaw the signing of the deals with Chinese companies.
 
 His successor Aset Isekeshev, in turn, oversaw the revision of some of the deal terms. All three men are political heavyweights who had for years - alongside Tokayev himself - been promoted by and became close to Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s sole leader for nearly 30 years.
 
 The offices of Isekeshev, who now manages Nazarbayev’s nonprofit foundation, and Tasmagambetov, who is Kazakhstan’s ambassador to Russia, declined to comment on Tokayev’s speech. Zhaksybekov’s office could not be reached for comment.
 
 Nazarbayev resigned last March, handing over the presidency to Tokayev in line with the constitution and backing him in the subsequent election.
 
 But the 78-year-old former Communist apparatchik retains the title of Yelbasy, the national leader, and enjoys sweeping powers as the chair of the security council and head of the ruling Nur Otan party.","['city', 'lrt', 'kazakh', 'chinese', 'bank', 'chinalinked', 'york', 'president', 'transport', 'light', 'orders', 'investigation', 'tokayev', 'project']","{'China': 1, 'Kazakhstan': 5}",,,,,

 Xi and Modi held nearly six hours of talks in an Indian seaside town in their second annual summit designed to break through decades of distrust over border disputes, trade rows and China’s close military ties with India’s arch rival, Pakistan.
 
 Relations were ruffled further in August when India revoked the special status of the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, angering both Pakistan, which claims the region, and its all-weather ally China.
 
 But the question of Kashmir was not discussed during Saturday’s summit and instead issues of trade and investment were taken up, Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said.
 
 China, embroiled in a bruising trade war with the United States, was quite appreciative of the imbalance in its own trade with India and willing to address it, Gokhale told reporters.
 
 “There was a good conversation on trade, an issue of concern; President Xi said China is ready to take sincere action in this regard and discuss in a concrete way how to reduce the deficit,” he said.
 
 Bilateral trade between China and India reached $95.54 billion in 2018, with the trade deficit at $53 billion in China’s favor, the biggest India has with any country.
 
 “One of the understandings the two leaders reached was that a new mechanism will be established to discuss trade, investment and services,” Gokhale said. The high-level group will be led by Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua.
 
 Indian generic drugmakers have long sought greater market access to China, as have India’s IT services. Xi said both were welcome.
 
 China, for its part, has been urging India to take an independent decision on telecom equipment maker Huawei’s bid for India’s proposed 3G network and not be swayed by U.S. pressure.
 
 The United States has asked its allies not to use Huawei equipment, which it says China could exploit for espionage. Beijing denies this accusation.
 
 In his opening remarks, Xi said he had a free and frank discussion with Modi and would pursue proposals the two leaders discussed to improve bilateral ties. “Yesterday and today we have engaged in candid discussions and as friends,” Xi said.
 
 “I look forward to further discussions, I may follow up on proposals discussed yesterday.” Xi did not elaborate.
 
 PERSONAL WARMTH
 
 In Mamallapuram in southern India, Modi took Xi on a personal tour of temple monuments dating back to the seventh and eighth centuries when Indian kingdoms cultivated trade ties with Chinese provinces.
 
 Modi noted in his opening remarks that he and Xi had agreed at a previous summit to manage their differences prudently and not let them snowball into disputes.
 
 India and China share a 3,500-km (2,200-mile) border, over which they went to war in 1962. The course of the frontier remains unresolved despite more than 20 rounds of talks.
 
 Xi also suggested the two sides expand cooperation in the military sector to boost trust.

 Xi headed to Nepal later on Saturday where he is expected to push for further Chinese involvement in developing its infrastructure as part of Beijing’s signature Belt and Road Initiative to boost trade and transport links across Asia.
 
 India has refused to join the BRI because a part of it runs through Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, which India claims as its territory.
 
 It has also said that the infrastructure projects must be tailored for the benefit of the host country and not drive them into debt, which has occurred in the case of the small island nations of Sri Lanka and Maldives.","['indias', 'indian', 'locked', 'tackle', 'chinese', 'trade', 'deficit', 'modi', 'agrees', 'china', 'summit', 'india', 'ties', 'xi', 'war']","{'China': 11, 'India': 24, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'Maldives': 1, 'Nepal': 1, 'Pakistan': 3, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

Informed that rival HSBC had just anointed a senior executive in Asia with the newly minted role of “Head of Belt and Road Initiative,” the financier exclaimed: “Damn, I wish we had thought of that first.”

 It was a common refrain during a week of meetings with Hong Kong’s financial community. HSBC’s move was a brilliant stroke of public relations designed to indulge Beijing in its quest to fulfill President Xi Jinping’s extraordinary ambition to recreate Silk Road trade routes for the modern age. The infrastructural extravaganza spans 80 countries and could involve up to $1.5 trillion of investment over the next decade.
 
 HSBC’s decision was more than just PR, though. As the Western bank with the deepest roots in the region, it should be more immersed in the concept than most of its New York and London rivals in helping to finance projects that will accompany Xi’s vision. And yet a single position at HSBC is telling in another way. It signals an inflating Belt and Road bubble.
 
 The hallmarks of speculative excess go beyond a fancy job title, though it has been a telltale sign from the tech boom to sovereign wealth fund hype. There are the conferences organised around the world, where would-be entrepreneurs come to skim something off the vast sums of development funds looking to build bridges, dig tunnels, lay railroad tracks and dredge ports. Investment advisers show up, too, creating new funds or stock-market indexes for ordinary punters to get in on the action.
 
 And in much the same way that American municipalities are prostrating themselves to host Amazon’s second headquarters, cities from Trieste to Algiers and even far-flung parts of South America – hardly stops on the old Silk Road – are finding ways to market themselves as nodes along the series of land and sea corridors designed to more efficiently connect the world’s soon-to-be largest economy with the rest of the planet.
 
 In short, the elements to make Belt and Road a catch-all for capital misallocation on an epic scale are proliferating. Unlike the last boom China fueled – a largely debt-driven bonanza of unoccupied buildings, ghost cities and underused highways – this time China is hoping to persuade the rest of the world to get carried away.
 
 The People’s Republic is already indicating it won’t be doling out money willy-nilly. Li Ruogu, the former president of the Export-Import Bank of China, said last week that many of the countries hoping to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative didn’t have the needed funds, according to the South China Morning Post. Speaking in Guangzhou, he is reported to have said these nations were already heavily indebted and needed “sustainable finance” and private investment.
 
 It’s a similar concern to the one highlighted last week in Beijing by International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde. “These ventures can also lead to a problematic increase in debt, potentially limiting other spending as debt service rises, and creating balance of payment challenges,” Lagarde said, after noting “the first challenge is ensuring that Belt and Road only travels where it is needed.”
 
 She added: “With any large-scale spending there is sometimes the temptation to take advantage of the project selection and bidding process.” Ignoring the IMF’s worries is another feature of any incipient exuberance. Two years before the great financial crisis, the fund’s chief economist warned about the risks associated with credit default swaps and undercapitalised financial institutions.
 
 It therefore would pay to heed some of the anecdotal signs surrounding BRI, the acronym by which Xi’s initiative is now known (an improvement on OBOR, for One Belt, One Road). For instance, there’s the upcoming event at Hong Kong’s Convention and Exhibition Centre, charging HK$3,200 ($408) to attend (with a 30 percent discount for “Belt and Road Portal User”). Further afield, similar events have taken place from Duisberg, Germany, to Bruges, Belgium, not to mention in the many countries China has identified as BRI-worthy.
 
 Investment funds are fueling the hype, too. In February, a division of HNA, the sprawling Chinese travel-to-finance conglomerate, said it would develop two funds targeting more than $3 billion of related infrastructure investments. Last month, Invesco, the asset manager, started the Belt and Road Bond Fund. And on Monday, Nomura published an extensive research report on how investors can capitalize on BRI, including a list of the 10 best Hong Kong - and China - listed stocks with exposure to the whole extensive project.
 
 Even M&A may play a part. Although acquisitions of foreign assets by Chinese companies have been curtailed, bankers in Hong Kong say the government is willing to bless transactions that have a Belt-and-Road flavour. That has included deals as speciously connected to the endeavour as last year’s takeover of a Brazilian port terminal in Curitiba for nearly $1 billion by China Merchants Port Holdings. Though Brazil was no Silk Road hotspot, it suggests that anything that can be deemed helpful to Xi’s global trade ambitions may get an approving nod from Beijing.
 
 That hints at the danger of BRI’s historic scale. There is little doubt that China can beneficially transform the way goods and people travel across the globe. As banks redesign their organisation charts and asset managers dream up new products, though, the one sure bet is that the Belt and Road will pave the way for many investors to lose their shirts along the way.","['funds', 'silk', 'way', 'breakingviews', 'cox', 'belt', 'hong', 'worrying', 'xis', 'week', 'president', 'paving', 'china', 'excess', 'road']","{'Belgium': 1, 'Brazil': 2, 'China': 9, 'Germany': 1, 'Hong Kong': 5}",,,,,

 The party’s amended charter, approved at the close of its twice-a-decade congress, pledged to “pursue the Belt and Road initiative”, a further sign of Xi’s expanding power and evidence that the ambitious “Silk Road”-like initiative will endure beyond Xi’s tenure.
 
 It also underscores how the Communist Party has increased its attention to foreign policy and reflects Xi’s growing desire for China to take a global leadership role, analysts said.
 
 “Everyone knows that the Belt and Road is very important to Xi, it has his personal stamp and authority,” said Peter Cai, a non-resident fellow at Sydney-based think tank Lowy Institute.
 
 “But to have major policy, especially an external engagement policy, to be written into a party constitution, at least in recent memory, it is something quite significant,” he said.
 
 First mentioned during a speech Xi gave to university students in Kazakhstan in 2013, the plan is a vehicle for China to take a greater role on the international stage by funding and building global transport and trade links in more than 60 countries.
 
 Xi has heavily promoted the initiative, inviting world leaders to Beijing in May for an inaugural summit at which he pledged $124 billion (£94 billion) in funding for the plan.
 
 Local Chinese governments as well as state and private firms have rushed to offer support by investing overseas and making loans.
 
 Some critics argue that China is exporting excess industrial capacity to spread its influence, and that the initiative, which has seen developing countries take on heavy debt, needs higher standards of governance and transparency.
 
 “China has made commitments and pledges to many developing countries and it will take that length of time, 10 years or more, to complete the initiative,” said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit.
 
 “This has also strengthened China’s soft power globally, so it wouldn’t make sense for China’s point of view to suddenly pull away from all of this,” he said.
 
 Other analysts said its inclusion could be a double-edged sword that adds pressure for the initiative, which remains broadly defined and leaves much to interpretation, to succeed.
 
 “The danger of having given it greater visibility is that actually there are going to be more of those efforts to play to the policy in a political way rather than considering carefully the costs and benefits of each portion of what one is doing,” said Dali Yang, a professor at the University of Chicago.
 
 Many private investors have jumped on the bandwagon to describe their projects as Belt and Road-related, while local governments have rolled out individual Belt and Road plans.
 
 The heads of Chinese firms including China Communications Construction Co and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation [SASAAI.UL] told Reuters during the week-long congress that they would place greater focus on developing their overseas businesses in support of the Belt and Road initiative.
 
 The party congress saw Xi cement his power ahead of a second five-year term and put him in the same company as the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, with the enshrinement of his political thought into the country’s constitution.","['charter', 'enshrined', 'initiative', 'greater', 'party', 'chinese', 'belt', 'xis', 'congress', 'china', 'xi', 'policy', 'road', 'pressure']","{'China': 11, 'Kazakhstan': 1}",,,,,

 Leaders from 29 countries will attend the Belt and Road forum in Beijing on Sunday and Monday, an event orchestrated to promote Xi’s vision of expanding links between Asia, Africa and Europe underpinned by billions of dollars in infrastructure investment abroad.
 
 While China’s outbound investment appears to be a key focus of the new Silk Road initiative, some Chinese provinces seen as strategic to the plans said they are also ramping up infrastructure investment.
 
 Officials from the Chinese province of Zhejiang, an affluent coastal province in eastern China, said it is planning new Belt and Road-related projects worth 123 billion yuan ($17.8 billion), and about half of that would be spent within the province, mainly on infrastructure.
 
 That includes a new $870 million railway to connect China’s manufacturing powerhouse Yiwu and port city Ningbo, connecting the province’s sea ports with continental ports, said Li Xuezhong, director of the provincial office of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).
 
 “Once completed, that would be very beneficial for improving the global logistic system,” Li said in a briefing ahead of the two-day forum.
 
 Another senior official from the southern province of Guangxi, bordering Vietnam, said on Saturday upgrading existing infrastructure to improve transportation speed “in all directions” within China is a key focus for the province.
 
 “We can only play a bigger role in the Belt and Road initiative if we do a good job in building transportation infrastructure to help (China’s) western region develop,” Zhang Xiaoqin, vice governor of Guangxi said at a separate briefing.
 
 Zhang added Guangxi is building a railway linking the provincial capital Nanning with the northern Gansu province, among other projects.
 
 China has depended on debt-fueled infrastructure investment to hold up growth which slowed to its lowest level in 26 years last year, even as China is looking to shift towards a more balanced economy more driven by consumption and services.
 
 Its economy grew a better-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, partly supported by an infrastructure spending spree which triggered concerns that it has once again resorted to old growth models.

 S UPPOSE YOU wanted to imagine a new world, or even a new world order. How, then, would you go about conjuring it up? You would do well to start with a name.
 
 Forget for a moment the significant problems of translating President Xi Jinping’s grand project for an English-speaking audience. In Chinese it is called yi dai yi lu: literally, “one belt, one road”.
 
 Such correlative, four-character phrases are common in Chinese, and imply balance, harmony, wholeness. Yi fu yi qi, or “one husband, one wife”, is monogamy; yi xin yi yi, or “one heart, one soul” means wholeheartedly. As Eyck Freymann at Oxford University writes in a forthcoming book, “One Belt One Road”, to a Chinese audience the phrase has a classical, even epic ring.
 
 It evokes an image of China “going forth to encompass the world on land and sea, at once opening to the world and binding the world more closely to China, in a balanced and harmonious way.” To a Chinese ear, that would carry echoes of the ancient concept of tianxia (literally, “all under heaven”), by which emperors ruled. In an orderly, peaceful hierarchy, your obligations depend on your relationships within the hierarchy. China’s status as hierarchical leader goes without saying. There are, admittedly, obligations there too. China keeps the whole cosmic show on the road.
 
 And in English? “One Belt One Road”, or OBOR for short, was the official name at launch. But in 2015 the Communist Party’s Central Compilation and Translation Bureau issued an English name change, to the “Belt and Road Initiative”, or BRI .
 
 That sounded easier on an English speaker’s ear. Not least, it allowed semantically for the possibility of multiple belts and roads (even if confusion remained about what a belt was, and why a road should go by sea).
 
 But calling the dream an initiative is suggestive. First, by abandoning the classical intimations implied in the Chinese phrase, a sense of China’s return to historical greatness has been removed for the benefit of foreign audiences. Second, a power that wants to conceal from other countries what, in terms of loftier ambitions for global pre-eminence, it is signalling to its own people, could do worse than choose a bland, unthreatening word like “initiative”.","['initiative', 'belts', 'english', 'roads', 'obligations', 'chinese', 'belt', 'yi', 'china', 'phrase', 'world', 'road']",{'China': 5},,,,,

What once would have been flattered to be called a hard-scrabble border town is now home to 200,000 people, giant outdoor video screens extolling the glories of a new Silk Road, and restaurants serving sashimi and European wine. Khorgos has become China’s gateway to Central Asia, and all the way to Europe.
 
 A twin town is going up in Kazakhstan. A duty-free mall already straddles the border for Kazakhstanis to get deals on booze, perfume and cut-price Chinese goods. But the key features, just across the border, are the giant gantry cranes more usually seen in the world’s ports. The Khorgos Gateway is a container terminal, a “dry port” built from scratch in 2014. The transport hub is intended as a critical link in what China’s president, Xi Jinping, has called the “Eurasian land bridge”. Among its investors is China’s COSCO , one of the world’s shipping giants. It is run by DP World, Dubai’s port operator. Last year the dry port handled 160,000 TEU s (a unit equivalent to a 20-foot container). Hicham Belmaachi, its Moroccan manager, expects that to rise to 400,000 in 2025.
 
 Khorgos is in the middle of nowhere: Eurasia’s pole of inaccessibility, the point on Earth farthest from any ocean, lies not far away. Now, beyond it, a vast new Eurasian supercontinent is forming. The promise is not just of railways through Central Asia to Europe but of gargantuan plans—some already realised—for pipelines, roads, high-speed rail and fibre-optic cables.
 
 It is reshaping the geography of the Earth’s biggest land mass. In this new space, the obstacles of the recent past—the Iron Curtain, China locked in its Mao-made autarky, even the physical impediments of the Himalayas, the Inner Asian deserts and the melting Arctic itself—are of diminishing consequence. The physical and psychological distance between Europe and East Asia is shrinking as the sparsely populated expanse at the heart of Eurasia is being wrangled, through new infrastructure, to manageable size. That, at least, is how Chinese planners see it. And, taking the historical view, if there is a surprise, it is that the transformation is not being made in the West’s image or according to its rules. Asia is coming to Europe, not the other way around.
 
 The Silk Road’s renaissance has been turbocharged as part of a Chinese expansion that has come to be known as the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ). The BRI is China’s signature, indeed all-encompassing, foreign policy—the “project of the century”, as Mr Xi calls it. But what exactly is it? Is it mostly aid or trade? Is it a Chinese Marshall Plan? Does it have real substance or is it just a branding exercise for China’s international rise? And why is the land part called a belt, and the sea part called a road?
 
 The Communist Party is using the BRI to reshape a world order more to its liking
 
 The World Bank has an elemental definition of the BRI : “a China-led effort to improve connectivity and regional co-operation on a trans-continental scale through large-scale investments”. That is a good summary as far as it goes, and helping poor countries build infrastructure is an important component. The global need for new infrastructure is immense. The Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) estimates that Asia alone needs to invest $26trn between 2016 and 2030, or $1.7trn a year, if it is to maintain economic growth, eradicate poverty and respond to climate change.
 
 But this special report will argue that, above all, the Chinese Communist Party is using the BRI to reshape a world order more to its liking. The focus is economic engagement and clever diplomacy. Leaders in Beijing ink BRI projects with countries for strategic or political reasons. Often, these are hidden by the sheer commercial anarchy that the BRI has engendered. (For those puzzled as to whether the BRI is a top-down, dirigiste initiative or a bottom-up frenzy, the answer is both.) Yet for China’s leaders, it represents a prototype for an emerging geopolitical bloc at a time when the rules-based order is under shaky American management.
 
 The notion of a new order, baldly stated, might alarm. So a more benign idea puts the BRI in a broader historical context: the tributary system of old. China sits at the centre of the world, bringing its wealth and power to bear, first on its near-abroad, and linking people into the concept of China as a beneficent power and an alternative locus to the West. Those who buy into it receive munificence from Beijing. Those who do not will not. It is a way to help knit together continents through improved infrastructure and a catch-all phrase to make anything China does abroad look unthreatening. Crucially, it is Mr Xi’s own baby: as much a political project to reflect well on the emperor as an economic one.
 
 One if by land, two if by Xi
 
 Mr Xi launched the initiative in two speeches in 2013. The first—in Astana (now Nursultan), the capital of Kazakhstan—presented the policy’s overland component, the “Silk Road economic belt”. It links China to Central, South-East and South Asia, and on to Europe. The word “belt” has that curious name to imply something more than mere transport, energy or other nodes. Rather, an interconnected network of infrastructure would grow into something thicker: industrial zones and economic corridors with manufacturing, logistics, construction and more.
 
 Soon after, Mr Xi presented the maritime component in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. A “21st century maritime Silk Road”, a network of port cities in the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean would tie China closer by sea to these regions. Mr Xi has unveiled further dimensions to the plan: a “polar Silk Road” to develop Arctic shipping routes; a “digital Silk Road” of undersea cables, 5 G telecoms and cloud computing; and even a “space information corridor” to open up satellite- and space-launch capabilities.
 
 The debates about the BRI began from the outset. At one level, it merely extended a trajectory China had followed for some time, meshing with its major resource suppliers worldwide, as well as its European markets. At another, it was a response to the global financial crisis of 2007-9, which removed a large source of demand for Chinese goods. The lesson was that in future China had to make its own markets abroad. At a third level, it represented an internationalisation of Chinese industrial policy. Faced with overcapacity in steel, cement and more, a party-state whose legitimacy hangs on creating jobs and investment could hardly shut down capacity, as Western countries might do. Instead it must try to export it. Lastly, at a time when the West appeared to be stumbling, both in terms of growth and global leadership, here was a bend in the historical road. Everything was contingent, but China’s moment had come and needed to be seized—more Leninist opportunism than Marxist determinism.
 
 The BRI is about all these things and more. Mr Xi calls it a decades-long project, while some estimates put spending on schemes both built and intended at $6trn. But sift through deals actually built or signed for, and the initiative is far smaller than some of the wilder figures imply. Yet it is so broad and amorphous it is meaningless to say you are for or against it. Any investment that China undertakes abroad can be, and is, lumped into it.
 
 Even inside China, where the party ensures unstinting praise for the BRI , a surprising vagueness reigns. No authoritative figure is published for what is invested where. The best guess is that $400bn of financing, in grants but especially in loans, has been or is about to be spent in more than 160 countries with three-fifths of the world’s population. In real terms, that dwarfs the Marshall Plan ($130bn in today’s money) that America advanced to revive Europe’s war-ravaged economies.
 
 But the economic benefits of projects often fall short of the claims made. A vast, bottom-up push to sell the BRI brand and pay lip-service to Mr Xi has produced hare-brained and duplicate schemes. Many provincial enterprises “going out” for the first time had no experience of operating abroad. At the first BRI Forum in Beijing in 2017, convened to spread awe and wonder at China’s generosity, there was already disorder under heaven. By the time of the second, last April, more disciplined guidelines were published about lending, the environment and more.
 
 Projects may fall short economically for another reason: their priority is strategic, above all, securing critical supplies of natural resources, to drive economic growth at home. Shanghai now gets half its natural gas from Turkmenistan. Such pipelines neatly get around the “Malacca Strait dilemma”: seaborne supplies of oil and gas that could easily be choked off in time of war.
 
 Elsewhere, strategic benefits might come from developing ports and cementing dominance in the global shipping industry. They could be stepping stones to China one day projecting naval power far from home—with big implications for Japan, South-East Asia, India and other countries that depend on the world’s busiest sea lanes. By rolling out infrastructure across the Eurasian land mass, China becomes the indispensable power in an emerging supercontinent. Crucially, the state directs giant enterprises to do the national bidding, and state banking institutions to provide the financial firepower.
 
 From a Communist Party perspective, cultivating political relationships, and what the party likes to call “people-to-people” ties, bends the world, bit by bit, to China’s will. As Bruno Maçães, a former Portuguese foreign minister, puts it in “The Dawn of Eurasia”, the spillover effects from infrastructure, trade and finance into politics, culture and security are not “a bug in the project”, but its most fundamental feature.
 
 Above all, the BRI is the world’s greatest branding exercise. A foreign country or leader usually signs up to the brand in the form of a vague memorandum of understanding lauding “win-win co-operation”. After that, it is very hard to be disloyal. Praise the plan and you will be rewarded. Criticise it, and not only have you offended China. You have offended the cosmos, or at least the “Silk Road spirit” of “peace and co-operation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit.” This branding, with sanctions, is powerful and it works. Foreign loyalty, in turn, reinforces the brand for a domestic Chinese audience: look what a peaceable, open and future-facing country China is, ready to join in endeavours for mutual benefit.
 
 Not everyone buys it. The harshest criticism comes from the incumbent superpower, whose global dominance the project is challenging. America’s National Security Strategy claims that the BRI is “predatory economics”; to borrow money from China is to fall into a well-laid trap. In December Adam Boehler, the head of the new US International Development Finance Corporation, told the Financial Times that China’s overseas investments were “100%” like a house of cards, because of heavy debts, badly built infrastructure, corruption and lack of transparency.
 
 That is an overstatement. Certainly, China applies dodgier lending criteria than do members of the Paris Club of major sovereign lenders. Yet there is no nefarious master plan. Indeed, that is part of the problem. Nearly every major project meets bumps along the way. Out of sight, deals often get renegotiated, with lower interest rates and longer grace periods and repayment terms.
 
 China knows flexibility serves its image best. It offers development money and diplomatic support not available elsewhere. If there is to be an American-led pushback, it must work by attraction, too, by offering developing countries better options than China does. The new connectivity must work well for client states.
 
 Laptops via Central Asia
 
 In January 2017 a train quietly pulled into the sidings on the outskirts of London. Its containers had started their journey just 12 days earlier in eastern China, less than half the time than had they gone by sea, at less than half the cost by air, travelling through Khorgos. The route is rapidly becoming more popular. HP , an American computer giant, has moved its computer factories to the inland Chinese city of Chongqing, building its business model on rail delivery via Khorgos to the Netherlands.","['silk', 'asia', 'chinese', 'belt', 'economic', 'chinas', 'infrastructure', 'china', 'centre', 'bri', 'xi', 'world', 'road', 'wants']","{'China': 32, 'Indonesia': 1, 'India': 2, 'Japan': 1, 'Kazakhstan': 4, 'Netherlands': 1, 'Turkmenistan': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 O NE TROPICAL evening in November, the 9,800-tonne Ile de Bréhat slipped from the quay at Honiara, capital of the Solomon Islands, and steamed out of Iron Bottom Sound. For weeks the boat had been a familiar sight as it finished its job of laying 4,700km of fibre-optic cable from Sydney to Honiara on Guadalcanal and 730km among the main outlying islands, with another branch heading to Port Moresby, capital of neighbouring Papua New Guinea. Less than a fifth of Solomon Islanders have access to the internet. The Ile de Bréhat is about to transform more lives than any ship since the Los Reyes, the first European vessel to discover the islands, in 1567.
 
 Two-thirds of the $93m cost of the Coral Sea Cable System was borne by the Australian government. It got wind that China was proposing to do the job, led by Huawei, China’s telecoms giant. Australian intelligence types view Huawei as a national-security concern. Australia is also the biggest donor to Pacific Island nations and is used to being top dog in its backyard. It told leaders in Honiara and Port Moresby that Huawei was not to be considered.
 
 Yet Australia has taken its eye off the Pacific in recent years, as China has stolen a march. Two-way trade with the Pacific has grown tenfold, from under $1bn in 2005 to over $8bn in 2018. Chinese tourists to the region jumped from under 4,000 a year a decade ago to more than 140,000 in 2017. China’s leaders extol the potential for BRI co-operation with Pacific nations. A “new Pacific diplomacy” has gathered pace since President Xi Jinping made his first trip to the region in late 2014. Pacific Island leaders frequently head for China.
 
 When Australia’s security establishment woke up to the growing Chinese presence, it did so with alarm. Australia had its way over Huawei. But just weeks before the Ile de Bréhat departed (and days before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China), the new Solomon Islands government switched diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China—as, too, did the atoll nation of Kiribati. The switch was accomplished with offers of bribes to MP s and, according to Graeme Smith, of the Australian National University, a $500m package of loans and grants dangled by a Chinese state enterprise before the prime minister.
 
 Huawei’s loss, in other words, is just one battle in a larger contest. Increasingly, the digital Silk Road, which Mr Xi declared at the second BRI forum last year to be a priority for co-operation, is gaining prominence. China, he says, must become a “cyber superpower”. That is fast becoming the most controversial aspect of the BRI too, as security concerns in the West grow over Huawei’s provision of fibre-optic cables and 5 G networks.
 
 Digital spending along the belt and road still lags that on energy and other hard-infrastructure projects. But, as the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin points out, it is growing fast. The institute has tracked at least $7bn in loans and investment in cables and telecoms networks, over $10bn on e-commerce, mobile payments systems and the like, and more on research and data centres. The digital dimension has expanded hugely from an initial focus on fibre-optic cables to cloud computing, big data and “smart city” projects.
 
 The approach, both with top-down guidance and bottom-up buccaneering, resembles the rest of the BRI (not least in the vagueness of the Silk Road terminology used). Most of China’s tech giants, such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent, are private firms and are more entrepreneurial than the state behemoths. But close links to the Communist Party and powerful financial incentives keep their activities aligned with state priorities—and help them to become global champions. Chinese banks provide funding, as they do to more traditional infrastructure companies. It was a concessionary loan that allowed Huawei to lay a 6,000km fibre-optic cable across the Atlantic, between Brazil and Cameroon.
 
 For China, it is not just a question of fostering world-beaters in high-tech. It also wants to encourage the wider adoption of homegrown cyber norms and standards. For instance, fintech brands like WeChat Pay and Alipay can help to internationalise the yuan and establish cross-border payments infrastructure to compete with SWIFT , the American-led system which currently dominates. Undersea cables and cloud computing could provide user data around the world, boosting China’s efforts to surpass America in artificial intelligence.
 
 While cheaper telecoms and easier ways to pay are welcome, China’s digital initiatives concern those who care about open societies. First, along with Chinese standards some countries are also signing up to its digital authoritarianism. In setting up telecoms systems, Huawei and others happily help states snoop on communications. Without its citizens’ consent, Zimbabwe supplies data to China’s facial-recognition programmes. That is one reason to predict that rivalry over BRI will in future play out more in the digital realm than in the world of concrete. A second is that, in tech, a small handful of huge firms dominate. The next 4bn internet users are a huge prize, one which China thinks it has a shot at winning.
 
 A final reason is that, even more than other dimensions, the digital one lends itself to dual-use possibilities. For instance, the global version of Beidou, China’s answer to America’s GPS, will launch this year, and will increase China’s surveillance and its military command-and-control capabilities. Beidou requires a network of ground stations around the world, for which China needs friendly states. For Mr Xi the Marxist, technology is, as Julian Gewirtz of Harvard University puts it, “power in practice...historical change in material form”. Many believe China intends the digital Silk Road to be the main stage on which the BRI plays out in future. The question is whether the West will let it.
 
 The answer will come in part from how Europe handles the challenge. In places the digital dimension China is pushing is indistinguishable from the others. For instance, Huawei’s 5 G proposals for Greece are pitched in part to help drive the next phase of the logistics transformation under way at Piraeus port, which Mr Xi calls the “dragon’s head” of Chinese investment in Europe.","['initiative', 'digital', 'pacific', 'silk', 'chinese', 'belt', 'xi', 'chinas', 'bri', 'china', 'huawei', 'growing', 'road', 'telecoms']","{'Australia': 7, 'Brazil': 1, 'China': 20, 'Cameroon': 1, 'Guinea': 1, 'Greece': 1, 'Kiribati': 1, 'Papua New Guinea': 1, 'Solomon Islands': 2, 'Zimbabwe': 1}",,,,,

That is a tall order. State media openly admit that the film, which had a nationwide première on August 30th amid much hype, received “major backing” from the government. It bears only a superficial resemblance to a drama pic.
 
 The Chinese term for BRI is rarely mentioned in the film. But it is all about the goodwill that China supposedly manifests through the project. The plot revolves around half a dozen unrelated people from all corners of the world, each benefiting in some way from the scheme. A schoolgirl in Kenya rides a new railway built by China (a guard is pictured at its terminus in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi). An unemployed woman in Jordan is hired by a Chinese internet firm—involved in the BRI ’s “digital Silk Road”—after local companies turn her down. The only aspect of the film that is overtly political is its title, which is shorthand for the much ballyhooed goal of President Xi Jinping’s foreign policy: “A community of common destiny for mankind”. At the film’s opening Martin Campbell, a New Zealander best known for directing the James Bond movies “GoldenEye” and “Casino Royale”, said “Common Destiny” would “deeply touch” audiences.
 
 Those audiences, however, appear indifferent, not stirred. In its first five days “Common Destiny” earned just 1m yuan ($140,000) at the box office. In contrast, “Wolf Warrior 2”, a jingoistic action thriller also related to China’s overseas influence-building, grossed 5.7bn yuan in 2017—a Chinese box-office record. One of the state firms behind that film is also an investor in “Common Destiny”.
 
 Indeed, a sizeable minority of online commenters on “Common Destiny” appear sceptical about the BRI itself. “We are a developing country, yet we frequently give money away to others,” laments one on Mtime, a movie review and ticketing platform (never mind that BRI involves few free handouts). Recent research by a Chinese academic, who asks not to be identified, is revealing. It found that only a third of comments on the BRI published online in China were “enthusiastic” about the project. Two-thirds were “neutral”.
 
 Some people may not like China, as an emerging great power and the world’s second-largest economy, being so closely identified with the developing world. In recent years the BRI ’s detractors in China have taken to mocking the project online by calling it da sa bi (“big spill of money”). This is a play on da sha bi, which literally means “big stupid cunt”. Censors have tried to keep up, but posts referring to the BRI as da sa bi can still be found.","['beltandroad', 'featuring', 'chinese', 'releases', 'online', 'bri', 'love', 'destiny', 'movie', 'china', 'da', 'drama', 'bi', 'film', 'party', 'common', 'project']","{'China': 7, 'Jordan': 1, 'Kenya': 2, 'New Zealand': 1, 'Oman': 1}",,,,,

The country counts as China’s only real ally, as a partner on China’s vulnerable western flank and a balancer against India. China gave Pakistani scientists the know-how and materials to build a nuclear bomb. A joint-venture slogan factory had long churned out declarations of a friendship “higher than the Himalayas”. So, although financing for BRI projects everywhere has slowed over the past year (see chart), Pakistan seems like a place where it should naturally have taken hold.
 
 Yet, in Karachi’s expo centre, staff from 120 Chinese firms are having little success as they stand, brochures and electronic translation devices in hand, touting everything from hoses to pumps to window frames. Alex Hou, from a firm in Zhejiang province that sells PVC film to factories, says Pakistani officials could have done a lot more to promote the event. More broadly, Pakistan is a lesson in how China can fumble the politics of its prime foreign policy.
 
 When the initiative emerged in 2013 it needed a signature project. The answer was the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC )—what China’s prime minister, Li Keqiang, called a transformative economic programme that “could wean the populace from fundamentalism”.
 
 The timing seemed fortuitous. In 2013 a civilian government came to power with a yen for big infrastructure projects and a promise to fix Pakistan’s notorious electricity blackouts. The price tag attached to CPEC grew from $46bn to over $60bn. Plans were drawn up for power plants, roads, railways and the development of a port at Gwadar, a fleapit on the Arabian Sea, that would, as the Pakistani planning minister boasted, “benchmark” Singapore.
 
 Yet as China was helping lay the ground for a boom in Pakistan, it failed to lay the political ground in the region. India in particular was touchy. (It still has not joined the BRI .) Meanwhile, all the talk of a new “corridor” brought opposition from hawks in Washington, DC . Since 2017, the administration of President Donald Trump has developed a pointed narrative: CPEC , it says, is driven above all by China’s long-term strategic objective to link its far western regions to the Arabian Sea, so as to have new energy routes and to project power into the western Indian Ocean. The scheme, the Americans say, will leave Pakistan in debt, littered with white elephants, internally divided and under Chinese sway.
 
 The Chinese government also misread Pakistan’s internal politics, as Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) swept to power having campaigned against corruption, including that in CPEC projects. Soon, the inexperienced PTI faced a full-blown balance-of-payments crisis to which the CPEC frenzy had contributed by pumping up domestic demand, pushing up the value of the currency and sucking in imports. In 2018 the bubble burst, the Pakistani rupee slid and the economy slowed sharply. Mr Khan, cap in hand, garnered help from China with conditions attached.
 
 In truth, CPEC was always a corridor only in name, says Andrew Small of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a Washington think-tank. Pumping oil or gas over high-altitude passes would cost too much and was never seriously considered. And Gwadar port has future strategic value to China regardless of the hinterland behind it. Rather, CPEC can better be understood as an investment package of roads, rail and power plants, some of which were useful but much of which will never come to pass.
 
 Too much is at stake for China to abandon CPEC . But ambitions have been pared right back. Only already agreed projects are likely to proceed, notably an $8bn railway from Karachi to Peshawar that the government can ill afford. The all-weather friendship will carry on, but where CPEC promised to take it to new heights, it has merely defined its limitations.
 
 All joined up
 
 South-East Asia has long been important to China’s economy—not least because of its 30m “overseas Chinese”, many with capital and management nous. In electronics and other sectors, the ten-country Association of South-East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) is enmeshed in China-centred supply chains. Three-fifths of China’s computer imports come from the region, along with a third of its integrated circuits. In the 12 years to 2017, Chinese investment in South-East Asia grew almost 30-fold, to nearly $40bn.
 
 Historically China’s intercourse with South-East Asia has been by sea. That, now, is changing. In recent years China’s industrial centre of gravity has shifted away from the coast towards the south-west, centred around Chongqing and Kunming, capital of Yunnan province. A priority of China’s belt is to improve cross-border transport. It squares with ASEAN ’s desire for regional integration. As elsewhere, the soft infrastructure lags the hard, particularly at borders. Hence a new body called the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative, set up with Singapore, to seek a single electronic platform for speeding up customs clearance.
 
 Most ASEAN states have long viewed their big northern neighbour with wary caution
 
 Yet China’s growing presence in South-East Asia comes at a price. Its grand projects, such as the high-speed railway under construction from Kunming to Singapore, and hydroelectric schemes along the Mekong river for exporting power, are of enormous importance to the leadership in Beijing. But an obsession with corridors does not always mesh with the interests of those who live along them. In tiny Laos, many villagers have been displaced by the railway and dams that bring little benefit to them.
 
 And, though they rarely say so in public, most ASEAN states have long viewed their big northern neighbour with wary caution. By contrast, Cambodia, under its long-serving strongman, Hun Sen, opened the door to China. In return for goodies, it has proved a staunch ally, frustrating ASEAN ’s efforts to resist China’s assertive maritime claims in the South China Sea.
 
 The impact on Cambodia of Chinese involvement has been immense and baneful. Dam-building threatens the once-abundant fish stocks of the Tonle Sap, Cambodia’s giant, seasonably expanding lake on which 1m fishermen’s livelihoods depend. The haunting ruins of Angkor Wat now have the feel of a Chinese theme park. Chinese land grabs for forestry concessions are threatening biodiversity. Corruption and Chinese development in the capital, Phnom Penh, go hand in hand. Chinese plans will up Cambodia’s carbon emissions by a tenth. And Cambodia’s (dollar-based) economy helps to get cash out of China: of its ten airlines, most are Chinese-owned and several reckoned to be laundering fronts.
 
 How this all plays out in Cambodia can be seen in the seaside town of Sihanoukville. It was once a sleepy, beach-flanked city beloved of holidaying Cambodian families and Western backpackers. Then the Chinese came. In 2015 Hun Sen’s government designated the city as one of Cambodia’s flagship BRI projects. Gambling for foreigners (though not Cambodians) was legalised in Sihanoukville, both online and in new casinos. Firms from China were welcomed. Some 80,000 Chinese—construction workers, investors, casino operators and tourists—arrived.
 
 More buildings are in a state of hasty construction than are completed—last year a high-rise collapsed, killing 28 workers. The city’s drains cannot cope. Maggie Eno, who runs the M’Lop Tapang school for street children, shows how monsoon floods turned the ground floor and playground into seas of raw sewage. Brothels operate out of plyboard shanties on construction sites. Thugs murder rivals in gangland killings, dumping victims’ bodies out of cars in the middle of town. And Sihanoukville’s beaches are piled high with plastic detritus from the Chinese invasion.
 
 Perhaps the worst is over. Last year the Cambodian government, reacting to the chaos at last, banned most gambling. In one of the town’s casinos recently, a Chinese construction foreman said he was having one last fling before heading home. The bubble has burst. But it will be many years before the city recovers. ■","['projects', 'cpec', 'asean', 'western', 'southeast', 'chinese', 'belt', 'chinas', 'eurasia', 'pakistan', 'china', 'power', 'smooth', 'investment']","{'China': 23, 'India': 3, 'Cambodia': 10, 'Pakistan': 13, 'Singapore': 3, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

In the 1400s Zheng He, a Muslim slave who became the Ming empire’s admiral, led seven voyages south and west. He offered treasure to every leader he met—but only if they acknowledged the emperor, joining a world order centred on Beijing.
 
 Chinese leaders today are following in Zheng’s wake. The “road” half of its Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI )—a global infrastructure-building scheme—is a maritime one of seaports and shipping channels. Xi Jinping, China’s president, has said it will create a new model of “win-win co-operation”. Some critics suspect nefarious motives, such as yoking poor countries to China by giving them unrepayable loans.
 
 The BRI has evolved site by site and Chinese officials have not made their intentions clear. However, the locations of the 22 maritime-road projects that we have identified as under way show how it is most likely to aid China. They suggest it will be more useful for protecting existing trade routes than expanding Chinese influence.
 
 To measure the maritime road’s impact, we tested three benefits it could offer China. If the road were a resource grab, its projects should cluster in places that sell raw materials that China imports. If its aim were to boost trade, it should track the busiest routes used by Chinese shipping today, or where trade is likely to grow fastest. And if it were intended to secure current trade routes, its ports should sit near choke points—areas whose closure would force goods to travel circuitously—or in places that offer alternative routes.
 
 We tested these explanations by using them to predict if countries host a BRI port. The results were conclusive. After holding other factors constant, there was no statistically significant link between having a BRI port and exporting raw materials that China wants, or having high current or projected trade with it. In contrast, the “trade-protection benefit”—either the value of Chinese trade in a country’s waters multiplied by the extra distance goods would have to go if those routes were shut, or the amount of trade that would be diverted to a country if shipping were disrupted elsewhere—was a good predictor. Given two otherwise average countries, one with a high trade-protection benefit (like Libya) is 2.7 times likelier to host a BRI port than another with an average benefit (like Liberia).
 
 Owning or running a port does not guarantee perpetual access, but it does give China influence by enabling it to disrupt the host’s own shipping if it chooses. Many overland “belt” routes in the BRI would also make Chinese trade more resilient. For example, if the Strait of Malacca were closed, China could switch to BRI ports it wants to build in Myanmar, and finish the trip on planned BRI rail lines.
 
 China’s military footprint also shows a focus on guarding trade routes. Its only base abroad is at Djibouti’s Bab al-Mandab Strait—the waterway whose closure would hurt China more than anywhere else. ■

Each time they complete a tunnel—at least three times in the past month—they hold a brief ceremony, waving Chinese flags for the cameras. They are celebrating not just their engineering success but also the evidence before them that the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ), China’s global infrastructure-building scheme, is making progress. The full railway is a long way off. Work has barely begun in Thailand, the next link. But the section in Laos should be in use by 2021.
 
 It will be a test of what many see as a big economic danger of the BRI : that it will saddle poor countries with unmanageable debts. China insists that its tens of billions of dollars in loans and investments are fostering global prosperity—a message that it is sure to repeat to foreign leaders attending the second Belt and Road Forum, which takes place from April 25th to 27th in Beijing (pictured is a floral display marking the event). But worries about the cost of the BRI , a project closely linked with President Xi Jinping’s foreign policy, have become widespread. Malaysia, Pakistan and Sierra Leone are among a growing list of countries that have delayed or scrapped China-led projects.
 
 There are three main concerns about the BRI ’s financial consequences. The most extreme is that the scheme involves what is pithily described as “debt-trap diplomacy”. In this view, China is deliberately overloading weak countries with loans; when they buckle, it seizes their assets and influences their politics. This idea has featured in speeches by some American officials, including the vice-president, Mike Pence, who see BRI as an attempt to undermine America’s global influence.
 
 Yet the investments funded by Chinese cash are not in China, so China has limited ability to grab assets when governments default. If it pushes too hard it may merely stoke antipathy. Instead, it usually responds by reducing the amount of money that debtors have to repay. Countries with longer records of lending to poor countries often do the same: the Paris Club of creditors was formed in 1956 to devise ways of reducing defaulters’ debt loads. The Centre for Global Development, a think-tank in Washington, has counted more than 80 cases between 2000 and 2017 in which China provided relief to its debtors overseas.
 
 An oft-cited example of China’s supposedly predatory approach involves Hambantota, a Sri Lankan port which has flopped commercially. In 2017 Sri Lanka handed control of the port to a state-owned Chinese company on a 99-year lease. But Deborah Brautigam of Johns Hopkins University says that of more than 3,000 China-financed projects that she and others have tracked, Hambantota is the only one that is used in support of the debt-trap theory. It is the exception, not the rule.
 
 What it lacks in malevolence, the BRI may make up in clumsiness. This is the second concern: that China is lending to vulnerable states without sufficient caution. Take a group of 37 poor countries monitored by the IMF . Loans from traditional bilateral lenders, including America and Japan, have declined from 7% of the debtors’ GDP to 2% over the past decade. Loans from China, by contrast, have soared from virtually nothing to 4%.
 
 It is welcome that China is supporting hard-up nations. But its enthusiasm generates foolhardiness. David Dollar of the Brookings Institution in Washington has found that Chinese development lending appears indifferent to political and economic risks. The Centre for Global Development has identified eight countries drowning in red ink that could be further swamped by BRI projects (see chart). A report in December released by Peking University ranked 94 BRI countries based on measures such as the quality of their financial regulation and their openness to trade. Pakistan came second to last. That is awkward for China: Pakistan may receive as much as $60bn in BRI loans, which would make it the biggest recipient of all.
 
 There is truth to claims that BRI credit can be ruinously expensive. Consider China Eximbank’s lending to Kenya for the Nairobi-Mombasa railway. Local reports say half the $3.6bn loan was priced 3.6 percentage points above a floating market interest-rate. That is high for a poor country. It is just one of many such loans by Eximbank, which said this week that its outstanding BRI -related credit was more than 1trn yuan, or nearly $150bn. The BRI ’s success will depend on whether Chinese lenders can tighten their procedures for assessing creditworthiness while making their loans more affordable. There are some promising signs. This week’s forum in Beijing is expected to stress the need for BRI debt to be sustainable. In the case of the railway in Laos, caution is already evident. The project involves $6bn of Chinese lending, which is about one-third of the GDP of Laos. So a joint venture has been created. It draws 70% of its capital from China and 30% from Laos. To fund its portion, Laos took a $465m loan from Eximbank. The loan was generous, according to local reports: it matures in 35 years at a 2.3% annual interest rate, well below the commercial price of such debt. Laos has five years before it has to begin making repayments. That is the kind of concession that it might have got from the World Bank. China may offer such generous terms more frequently. Last year it set up an agency to oversee its foreign aid, in part to turn the BRI into a more co-ordinated development programme. But this points to another concern that will be harder for China to deal with because it relates to the very nature of the BRI : its sheer ambition. Potential benefits look impressive. A recent study by the World Bank concluded that BRI transportation projects could lift global GDP by 3%. That is larger than the benefits that are usually shown to be generated by free-trade agreements. It could yet bear out China’s notion that Westerners (save Donald Trump) just want to lower tariffs, whereas China is trying to build the roads that let trade happen. This, though, is where the risks come in. The World Bank’s rosy analysis assumes that BRI projects are completed and work efficiently. The scale of the effort is a huge challenge, and such projects are a magnet for graft. Vast sums are being spent quickly in badly run places. The railway in Laos ought to make the landlocked country more accessible. But for it to prove effective, much more will be needed: better roads to link it to existing transport, new urban centres around the stations and freer trade with other countries.
 
 China cannot achieve this alone, but its often overweening approach to the BRI has alienated potential partners. America, India and Japan want little to do with it. One reason is that China is, in effect, asking others not only to sign up to its infrastructure plans but also to endorse Mr Xi’s worldview. It does not help that China reveals so little about its lending and that contracts go mainly to Chinese firms.","['initiative', 'countries', 'projects', 'jitters', 'laos', 'chinese', 'tries', 'belt', 'ones', 'lending', 'trap', 'china', 'bri', 'loans', 'global', 'road', 'calm', 'railway']","{'China': 22, 'India': 1, 'Japan': 2, 'Kenya': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 2, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Pakistan': 3, 'Sierra Leone': 1, 'Thailand': 1}",,,,,
316,Economist,https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/02/13/indonesias-government-wants-to-get-on-with-china-in-private,0,,UK,W,2020-02-13 00:00:00,Banyan - Indonesia’s government wants to get on with China in private,"W HEN CHINA’S president, Xi Jinping, launched the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) in 2013, Indonesia was seen as essential to its success. So much so that he went to Jakarta, its capital, to launch the maritime dimension of his world-girdling programme of infrastructure investments. But then a funny thing happened: very little. Nearby Cambodia has been overrun by Chinese involvement in its economy and politics. In Pakistan BRI and its local iteration, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), are held up as proof of a relationship “as close as lips and teeth”—even as CPEC goes off the rails. In contrast, most Indonesians have never heard of China’s signature foreign policy. Banyan’s recent informal poll of residents of Jakarta was nearly unanimous: BRI is a financial institution, Bank Rakyat Indonesia.
 
 China’s involvement in Indonesia is growing, but it got going late. One reason is the long slow process of getting any project off the ground. Public consultations drag on, land is a nightmare to acquire, bureaucrats block licences and sleazier ministers wonder what is in it for them. One minister under President Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, admits that the Indonesian way is hardly ideal, but at least the country avoided many of the reckless, grandiose projects and poor financial terms embraced by faster-moving neighbouring countries. The only real albatross, a planned high-speed railway from Jakarta to Bandung, is a cautionary tale. In 2015 China beat Japan in the bid for its construction by not insisting on government guarantees for its loans. Quickly the usual problems emerged: even the air force, with a base in the path of the train, objected. Last year all the land was at last acquired. But the project is years late and over budget. Since no broader high-speed network is envisaged that offers economies of scale, the 150km line will never pay for itself. The railway is China’s flagship project in Indonesia, but Indonesian ministers do not want to talk about it.
 
 The railway is also a lesson in the sometimes ugly sensibilities over the nearly 3m Indonesians of Chinese origin, which in turn shape Indonesia’s engagement with China. Chinese have been doing business in Indonesia for centuries, and today form a big part of the entrepreneurial class. Anti-Chinese antagonisms date back at least to colonial times, when the Dutch appointed ethnic Chinese as tax farmers even as they encouraged occasional pogroms against Chinese traders, builders and sugar-mill workers. In the 20th century some Indonesian nationalists defined themselves in part by their anti-Chineseness. After independence, hatred boiled over in 1965 following an alleged left-wing coup attempt. Ethnic Chinese were seen by many as communist sympathisers. Chinese Indonesians were among those targeted in army-directed massacres in which hundreds of thousands of people died. Anti-Chinese riots erupt around the archipelago from time to time. And in 2017 the ethnic-Chinese and Christian governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, or Ahok, an ally of Jokowi, was jailed on trumped-up charges of blasphemy. A rabble-rousing politician, Prabowo Subianto, who said Ahok should “know his place lest the Indonesian Chinese face the consequences of his action”, is now the minister of defence.
 
 The railway was also criticised, caught in a broad surge of anti-Chinese sentiment. The government has drawn its own conclusions. All the other big projects backed by China are to be built far from the Javanese heartland where, one official explains, “a lot of the religious conservatives and Muslim hardliners are collected”. They include an oil refinery in northern Sumatra near the Malacca Strait, a smelter on Sulawesi that allows Indonesia to process its nickel ore for the first time, and planned hydropower plants in northern Kalimantan to encourage aluminium smelters to move from China.
 
 Indonesia, then, mostly engages with China on its own terms—and a Chinese commitment for a training college to teach Indonesians about nickel processing is further proof of that. At times it will even be seen to stand up to China, as in a maritime spat last month in which the navy and coastguard expelled a Chinese fishing fleet from Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone. The move led some observers to imagine that Indonesia will unite its South-East Asian neighbours against China in the South China Sea. But that is wishful thinking. Jokowi must appear robust to anti-China forces at home. But, for the economy to grow, he must court Chinese money.","['indonesia', 'chinese', 'seen', 'indonesians', 'banyan', 'jakarta', 'private', 'china', 'indonesias', 'jokowi', 'project', 'indonesian', 'wants', 'railway']","{'China': 14, 'Indonesia': 18, 'Japan': 1, 'Cambodia': 1, 'Pakistan': 2}",,,,,

 Beijing is in prime position to capitalize on major policy fissures that have emerged between Europe and the Trump administration on climate, trade and defense.
 
 The new dynamic will be on full display on Thursday in Brussels, when Chinese Premier Li Keqiang meets with EU counterparts at the annual EU-China Summit. Hours later, President Trump is expected to announce the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement.
 
 ""If peace and prosperity are the object of the global economic order, the Trump administration offers neither to Europeans,"" wrote analysts at High Frequency Economics, a research firm. ""A new axis of power, based on economic power, will form between Europe and China if the U.S. continues to shirk its role as global leader.""
 
 Beijing appears to be chomping at the bit, having asked for the summit to be moved forward to June.
 
 A closer relationship between the two giant economies is easier said than done, however. There are major questions over the compatibility of the economic systems promoted by Europe and China, as well as differences over flashpoint issues including human rights.

 Whose globalization is it anyway?
 
 Europe and China have both been unsettled by Trump's confrontational stance on trade.
 
 With the United States fueling fears of protectionism, Brussels and Beijing are advocating free trade. But that doesn't mean they're on the same page.
 
 Chinese President Xi Jinping has styled himself as a defender of globalization, making a keynote speech at Davos and hosting an international summit about China's grand plan to foster more trade.
 
 But Xi's signature ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative, which some critics say is a neo-colonial project with China at its core, has provoked wariness in Europe.
 
 Related: China has a grand plan to dominate world trade
 
 Top European leaders were absent from a Beijing summit in May that focused on the plan, and a key lobby group expressed doubts publicly.
 
 ""Trade must flow in both directions to make the new trading routes both economically viable and politically acceptable to the foreign countries through which it will pass,"" Jorge Wuttke, the president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China at the time, wrote in an opinion article for the Financial Times.
 
 He said that for every five trains full of cargo that leave the Chinese city of Chongqing for Germany every week, only one full train returns.

 Buying power
 
 One of the most sensitive issues in the EU is the increasing number of European companies being bought up by Chinese firms.
 
 Chinese direct investment in EU countries soared 77% last year to $35 billion, according to a study by Rhodium Group and the Mercator Institute for China Studies. That's more than five times the total for 2013.
 
 By contrast, direct investment from EU companies in China dropped to $8 billion in 2016, the fourth consecutive year of decline.
 
 Chinese investment in Europe especially targeted technology and advanced manufacturing businesses, according to the Rhodium study. That trend has raised fears in counties like Germany of a loss of crucial industrial technology to Chinese buyers.
 
 It's a particular concern because China doesn't allow a similar degree of investment in key sectors of its own economy.
 
 Ahead of this week's summit, European businesses are calling on Beijing to ""walk the talk"" on globalization by allowing them greater access to restricted industries.
 
 Earlier this year, the EU Chamber of Commerce slammed Beijing over its strategy to boost China's own high-tech industries like robotics and electric cars.

 Trade disputes
 
 Brussels and Beijing have also had their share of traditional trade spats.
 
 The latest example came in May, when Europe slapped anti-dumping duties on pipes and tubes made from steel and iron in China. It's one of dozens of similar measure imposed in recent years.
 
 Chinese companies, many of them owned by the state, stand accused of dumping steel on foreign markets at very low prices as demand slowed at home.
 
 Beijing, meanwhile, has other priorities: It keeps steel factories running at full capacity because they keep millions of workers in well-paid jobs.
 
 But there's also a cost: Unions and politicians in Europe's industrial heartland of Germany, Belgium and northern Italy complain bitterly of Chinese trade practices.
 
 A new era
 
 Still, there are areas where Europe and China should be able to find common ground. Climate is a prime example.
 
 In a draft statement ahead of the summit, Beijing and Brussels agreed to accelerate what they call the ""irreversible"" shift away from fossil fuels.
 
 Li reinforced the message during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
 
 ""We are going to move forward,"" he said. ""We ask the other countries to cooperate with us, to do it together.""

 That sentiment -- combined with a diminished leadership role for the U.S. -- could lead to more cooperation and a deepening of the relationship between China and the EU.

 At a time when President Trump is pulling out of or threatening to kill major trade deals, his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, is styling himself as a defender of globalization.
 
 But a lot of questions still surround the centerpiece of Xi's push to strengthen China's influence beyond its borders -- the One Belt, One Road initiative.
 
 Launched nearly four years ago, the plan aims to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into railways, roads, ports and other projects across Asia, Africa and Europe. However, some critics say it's a murky program that could end up being a massive waste of resources.

 It's one of several steps China has taken to increase its global clout in recent years, which also include setting up a rival to the World Bank and pushing a regional trade deal in Asia. And this weekend, some of the world's most powerful leaders are gathering in Beijing for a summit centered on One Belt, One Road.
 
 But top leaders from the G7 economies aren't expected to attend, except for Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.
 
 ""Europe is more accepting of this initiative than the U.S.,"" said Tianjie He of Oxford Economics. ""But many developed world countries still aren't comfortable with the rising power of China.""
 
 Related: Just what is this One Belt, One Road thing anyway?
 
 Still, Xi will host 29 heads of state and government leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Rodrigo Duterte from the Philippines. The U.S. is expected to be represented by Matthew Pottinger, the National Security Council's senior director for Asia.
 
 On the face of it, China's big plan boasts some impressive numbers.
 
 The countries involved are home to 60% of the world's population and account for roughly a third of the world economy. By 2050, those countries are expected to contribute 80% of global GDP growth, up from 68% at the end of last year, according to Oxford Economics.
 
 ""The Chinese have learned that the best way to create economic growth is to create good jobs,"" said Jin-Yong Cai, the former CEO of the investment arm of the World Bank. ""When you look at the world, particularly the emerging economies, the most critical impediment to economic growth is lack of infrastructure.""
 
 Projects in the works include thousands of kilometers of highways in Pakistan, an international airport in Nepal and a rail link between China and Laos. Big global companies like GE and Siemens are aiming to cash in on the plans, alongside Chinese construction firms.
 
 But the initiative's intended effects aren't likely to be seen for years. And some observers question whether the vast amount of investment will be effective.
 
 ""Will this month's event be remembered as a step in the next stage of globalizing China's economy, or as a huge white elephant that left an enormous amount of wasted resources strewn along its path,"" Jorge Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, wrote in an opinion article for the Financial Times this week.
 
 He described it as ""less of a practical plan for investment than a broad political vision.""
 
 Related: Trump's decision to kill TPP leaves door open for China
 
 Other experts say Chinese money is mostly skipping the key developing nations targeted by the initiative.
 
 David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in a blog post this week that China's main destinations for direct investment are still the usual suspects: Europe, the U.S., Australia and Canada.
 
 Being a country along the Belt and Road, he found, has not resulted in more Chinese investment than is received by other parts of the developing world.

 And while China is happy to pump money into other countries around the world, it's much less willing to accept foreign investment in many parts of its own economy.
 
 ""We obviously ... hope that China will implement domestically what it is preaching globally,"" Hans Dietmar Schweisgut, EU ambassador to China, said in Beijing this week.

 President Donald Trump refused to endorse a joint communique with America's closest allies as the Quebec summit ended in chaos, in stark contrast to the carefully choreographed meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in China.
 
 While Trump clashed over tariffs with other G7 leaders like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, China orchestrated an agreed statement on trade and security between the countries attending its summit in the city of Qingdao.
 
 The language of the statement, which ""stressed the importance of ... consistently strengthening and developing the multilateral trade system,"" echoed recent talking points of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has sought to cast himself as the defender of global free trade.
 
 Many experts question his credentials for that role, given China's own trade practices. But Trump's recent barrage of tariff announcements and attacks on the World Trade Organization give Beijing plenty of opportunities to position itself as a power that is committed to working with others to address global challenges.
 
 Xi, Modi and Putin
 
 Chinese state media seized the chance to contrast the G7 with the SCO summit, which was attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and the leaders of several other Asian countries.
 
 Related: Forget the G7, China's summit is where the economic growth is
 
 ""Against the backdrop of rising unilateralism and anti-globalization, the SCO's opposition to trade protectionism in any form is especially encouraging,"" state-run newspaper China Daily said in an editorial published in English.
 
 Another state-run media outlet, People's Daily, posted a tweet comparing photos of leaders at the two summits. The G7 picture showed a seemingly tense moment between European leaders and Trump, while the SCO image showed a group led by a smiling Xi and Putin.

 The SCO includes the world's two fastest growing major economies. China alone is expected to contribute around 30% of the total increase in global GDP over the next decade, with India accounting for another 10%, according to IHS Markit.
 
 But analysts say the Chinese summit is more about pomp than real policy.
 
 ""It is highly superficial and has never resulted in any significant cooperation between its members on security, economic, or political issues,"" said Scott Kennedy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington.
 
 Belt and Road divisions
 
 The surface unity of the event masks divisions between its members, notably on China's Belt and Road initiative, an ambitious plan to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into ports, rail lines and other projects across Asia, Africa and parts of Europe.
 
 Related: How did China end up posing as the defender of global trade?
 
 India is unhappy about the partnership China is developing with Pakistan through the initiative. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a key component of Belt and Road, passes through the disputed region of Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim in its entirety.
 
 In the official statement Sunday on the outcome of the SCO summit, India was absent from the list of countries affirming support for the Chinese initiative.
 
 The SCO started out in 2001 as a forum to resolve border disputes in Central Asia, but has since expanded to include more countries and cover other issues like trade. It has eight permanent members: China, Russia, India, Pakistan and four Central Asian countries. Four more countries, including Iran, have observer status.
 
 But critics say that as the organization grows, it becomes even more unwieldy and less likely to achieve tangible results.
 
 ""No one in Washington or other Western capitals is terribly worried about the SCO being a shadow G7 or source of a genuine counter-narrative to the liberal international order,"" Kennedy said.

 The multibillion-dollar rail line was supposed to connect Malaysia's east coast to the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and Thailand. The East Coast Rail Link was also meant to provide a trade route connecting China with markets beyond Asia.
 
 The bulk of the work on the 620-kilometer (385-mile) rail line was awarded to state-owned China Communication Construction Company last year, and 85% of the financing was provided by the Export Import Bank of China.
 
 Malaysia Rail Link, the company managing the project, confirmed reports that it had ordered the Chinese construction firm to suspend work on Wednesday. It declined to comment further.
 
 The move came a day after Malaysia's finance minister said the total bill for the China-backed project was 81 billion Malaysia ringgit ($20 billion), far higher than earlier estimates. He said the cost would have to come down significantly for the project to be financially viable, according to Malaysian state news agency Bernama.
 
 Related: Malaysia ditches Singapore rail link
 
 The Malaysian finance ministry and China Communication Construction Company did not respond to requests for comment.
 
 The suspension of the East Coast Rail Link is a signal Malaysia's new leader, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, is making good on his promise to rein in China's influence.
 
 And it comes just over a month after Mahathir said he was ditching a planned $17 billion high-speed rail link with Singapore, saying it cost too much and likely wouldn't benefit many commuters.
 
 His predecessor, Najib Razak, was a big proponent of China's Belt and Road initiative, Beijing's grand plan to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into ports, rail lines and other projects across Asia, Africa and parts of Europe. Under Najib, Malaysia signed up for an estimated $34 billion worth of infrastructure projects under the Chinese initiative, according to research firm Gavekal.
 
 Mahathir wants to renegotiate the terms of those deals with Beijing.
 
 ""We hope to reduce costs a lot, because of a lot of wrong things [are] being done,"" he said at a news conference in June, referring to the East Coast Rail Link and the billions Malaysia would have to borrow from China to finish it.

 Some experts fear Belt and Road projects may pile debt onto smaller countries, putting China in a strong position to influence their strategic decisions or even gain control of important infrastructure.
 
 That has already happened in Sri Lanka, where the port of Hambantota racked up heavy losses and was eventually signed over to its Chinese creditors last year.
 
 Halting the East Coast Rail Link may help Malaysia avoid that fate, according to National University of Singapore fellow Johan Saravanamuttu.
 
 ""Loan terms and conditions need to be renegotiated to avoid the Hambantota port syndrome of over leveraged loans,"" he said.
 
 The Financial Times reported that Malaysia has also suspended two China-backed pipeline projects this week, citing a senior Malaysian Finance Ministry official.

 I am in Chengdu, China this week attending the 22nd Summit of the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Again, I am struck by the sheer size and scale of this country, a fact so often not understood by people in the West.
 
 Chengdu is a city of 15 million people, according to the latest census numbers. That makes it twice as big as London or New York City. Incredibly, Chengdu is only China's fourth largest city behind Chongqing, Beijing and Shanghai. Oh yes, I mustn't forget, Chengdu is also home to the giant pandas, which I was fortunate enough to see.
 
 Here in Chengdu, the chairman of the China National Tourism Administration outlined the government's plans to extend its Belt & Road Initiative deep into the field of tourism. More than 60 countries spanning Asia, Africa, Eurasia and Europe have signed up to the initiative that has the Chinese spending billions of dollars developing three land routes and one maritime routes along the old Silk Road.
 
 Now ask yourself: What initiative is the West putting forward for the future to cement its leadership? I don't see any grand plan from the EU for the rest of this century, in terms of cementing trade relations. As for the United States, the Trump administration withdraws from the Paris climate accord, abandons the Trans-Pacific Partnership and threatens ending NAFTA, all while cutting back development aid. It begs the question: What is Washington's big vision for the future, besides putting America first?
 
 The reality is the Belt & Road Initiative, also known as One Belt, One Road, tied in with Russian involvement, is possibly the most far-reaching and deep-thinking plan for the future. Love it or be terrified of it, while others bicker parochially the Chinese are way ahead in strategic thinking, decades ahead.
 
 Whether Belt & Road reaches its full potential really isn't my point. It's the very fact that there is leadership, which others can enjoin, that should give Western leaders pause for thought.

 Pakistan's central bank said it has officially adopted China's yuan as a currency for trade between the two countries, which are neighbors and allies.
 
 That means companies in China and Pakistan can now trade directly in yuan instead of having to use currencies such as the U.S. dollar.
 
 The decision was announced shortly after Trump lashed out at Pakistan. He used his first tweet of 2018 to say the United States had ""foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies and deceit.""
 
 The Trump administration subsequently confirmed it would continue to withhold $255 million. Pakistan's government expressed ""deep disappointment"" at Trump's remarks, describing them as ""completely incomprehensible.
 
 China already accounts for around 28% of Pakistan's imports -- more than any other country -- according to official data. And China is Pakistan's third biggest export market, behind the U.S. and U.K.
 
 The currency move will likely boost China's proposed global trade route -- the One Belt, One Road initiative -- which passes through Pakistan. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), unveiled by President Xi Jinping in 2015 with a pledge to invest at least $46 billion in Pakistan, has already deepened links between the countries.
 
 Companies will be free to choose whether to conduct trade in yuan, dollars or other international currencies such as the euro or yen, but Pakistan's central bank made clear it expected the Chinese currency to assume a big role.
 
 ""Considering the recent local and global economic developments, particularly with the growing size of trade and investment with China under CPEC, [the bank] foresees that [yuan] denominated trade with China will increase significantly, going forward; and will yield long term benefits for both the countries,"" it said.
 
 Bilal Khan, Pakistan economist at Standard Chartered, said the dollar was likely the principal currency for Pakistan's international trade, but that could change.
 
 ""Given Pakistan's large external financing requirements -- in part due to imports of capital goods to sustain CPEC projects -- the settlement of trade in [yuan] should help ease pressure on [foreign exchange] liquidity,"" he told CNNMoney.","['currency', 'cozies', 'pakistans', 'bank', 'trade', 'yuan', 'president', 'pakistan', 'china', 'cpec', 'trump']","{'China': 9, 'Pakistan': 15, 'United States': 1}",,,,,
323,CNN,https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/news/economy/china-trump-trade-negotiations-result/index.html,0,,USA,W,2018-05-22 00:00:00,Analysis: China is playing the long game against Trump,"China knows what it's doing in negotiations with President Donald Trump on trade.
 
 In recent months, Beijing has shown a willingness to make concessions. It's lowering tariffs on auto imports. It's opening its financial markets to foreign lenders. And it will start allowing US automakers to make cars in the country without local business partners.
 
 But as notable as those changes are, China is standing firm on big issues. It's plowing ahead with its plan to dominate tech, including artificial intelligence. At the same time, China is pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure projects in Asia, Africa and Europe — buying years of goodwill and geopolitical influence.
 
 Trump, meanwhile, focuses on the trade deficit. But economists say that fixation is misplaced. China will continue to be a giant producer on the global stage, while the US economy is driven by consumer spending.
 
 It would take enormous long-term guarantees to alter the trade imbalance in a meaningful way — not just increases to agriculture and energy exports, which China pledged over the weekend.
 
 ""This is China humoring the US,"" said Phil Levy, senior fellow on the global economy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.
 
 On Tuesday, the Chinese Finance Ministry said China will cut import duties on passenger vehicles from 25% to 15% starting on July 1.
 
 It's a flashy move that would let the United States claim a win. President Trump singled out China's tariffs on cars for criticism last month, pointing out that they're far higher than the 2.5% import duty on autos levied by the United States.

 ""Does that sound like free or fair trade?"" Trump tweeted. ""No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years!""
 
 When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 9, 2018
 
 The easing of import duties isn't the only move China has made recently to show that it's willing to liberalize its economy.
 
 The Chinese government has also promised to remove restrictions on foreign carmakers that want to manufacture vehicles in the country.
 
 Previously, companies such as GM (GM) and Volkswagen had to form joint ventures with local partners in which the Chinese companies have the controlling stake. China said last month it will phase out those rules by 2022.
 
 And Beijing is working to lift restrictions on foreign access to the country's banking, securities, insurance and asset-management markets, with changes expected by the end of June.
 
 Such shifts benefit China on two fronts, according to Levy. They temporarily appease the United States, and they make it look like China is taking steps to become a team player on global trade, he said.

 At the same time, China remains full speed ahead on its state-directed push to dominate high tech fields from electric cars to 5G wireless technology.
 
 ""The US is not going to change China's approach to technology policy,"" said Samm Sacks, senior fellow in the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""They certainly are not going to do it from any unilateral US action.""
 
 Beijing is also expanding its global clout by investing in ports, rail lines and other development projects through its Belt and Road initiative.
 
 These plays for global dominance could position China as a much bigger threat to US hegemony down the road.
 
 The Chinese government knows that Trump remains laser focused two big issues: North Korea and the trade deficit.
 
 Trump has made clear that he wants a potential summit with North Korea in June to happen, and he wants China to keep pressure on North Korea.
 
 Additionally, the president's emphasis on the trade imbalance has allowed China to provide the United States with nominal victories by making commitments to purchase more goods.
 
 Even on this, experts are skeptical. Global saving and spending patterns are fairly entrenched, making bilateral trade deficits difficult to manipulate.
 
 ""If your metric is the US deficit on trade with China, the programs that have been unveiled so far are not going to decrease it significantly,"" said Nicholas Lardy, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and expert on the Chinese economy.

 The country's top leaders are gathered in Beijing this week for the National Congress of the ruling Communist Party, an event that takes place just twice a decade and is the peak of China's political calendar.
 
 For Xi, it's a chance to tighten his already strong grip on power as he prepares for a second five-year term. During his first five years, he made it clear that the Party's interests take precedence over market forces -- and many experts expect that to continue.
 
 ""If there's a clash, the market has to be subordinate,"" said Yanmei Xie, a Beijing-based analyst at research firm Gavekal.
 
 Related: China's party congress: What you need to know
 
 Xi's first term was full of drama: a far-reaching anti-corruption campaign that swept up business leaders and top officials; a stunning stock market crash that wiped out many people's savings; and sharp plunges in the Chinese currency that contributed to fears of a collapse of the country's economic growth.
 
 Despite the turmoil, the economy has managed to keep chugging along, expanding at a rate that many Western nations can only dream of. But experts say Xi's government has failed to move quickly enough to deal with the bigger issues that threaten China's long-term economic health, such as soaring debt and bloated state-run companies.
 
 Can he do better over the next five years?
 
 Heavy hand of the state
 
 Xi has spent the past five years opening up some parts of the Chinese economy, but retaining the government's firm grip elsewhere.
 
 Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist at AXA Investment Managers, points out the government has made China's currency more market-based and now allows foreigners to invest in the local stock market.
 
 Related: China's debt risks are rising
 
 The International Monetary Fund endorsed China's yuan as a reserve currency two years ago -- putting it in an elite club that includes the U.S. dollar and British pound.
 
 But the heavy hand of the state has remained evident. Government agencies clumsily intervened when the stock market crashed in 2015 and triggered alarm in global markets by devaluing the yuan without warning.
 
 Meanwhile, foreign companies frequently complain that Chinese authorities ensure preferential conditions for domestic firms.
 
 Making China great again
 
 Chinese companies' global deal-making provides a clear example of the government's willingness to intervene under Xi.
 
 Last year, Chinese companies splurged a record $170 billion on overseas deals, following calls from political leaders to increase China's clout in international markets.
 
 But acquisitions have almost halved so far this year after Beijing cracked down on the massive amounts of money moving out of the country, which were putting huge pressure on the yuan. That threw a spanner in the works of high-profile deals by top companies like Dalian Wanda Group, a real estate and entertainment conglomerate.
 
 The yuan has since stabilized, but analysts don't expect a new deal-making splurge.
 
 ""You have to make money that serves the national interests,"" said Gavekal's Xie, who expects China's overseas investments to focus on things like technology in the future.
 
 Opinion: How China's 'opening up' is helping the world economy
 
 Huge sums are also expected to be channeled into Xi's grand plan for building up roads, ports and other infrastructure along the historic ""silk road"" trading routes across Asia, Europe and Africa. Dubbed the ""Belt and Road Initiative,"" it aims to create a growing trade network with China at its heart.
 
 ""It's part of Xi's ambition to make China great again on the global stage,"" Yao said. That goal has been helped by President Trump's protectionist moves, such as pulling the U.S. out of the TPP, the giant free trade agreement spanning the Pacific that was spearheaded by the Obama administration.
 
 Debt buildup
 
 But experts warn that China has neglected some of the big underlying problems in the economy under Xi's reign.
 
 Take the huge buildup of debt since the global financial crisis. China's decade-long credit binge has fueled its economic growth, but corporate debt last year rose to an eye-watering 234% of gross domestic product, according to the International Monetary Fund.
 
 Two top credit ratings agencies -- Moody's and S&P -- have downgraded China this year, warning about the country's debt levels.
 
 Related: China's five most powerful people
 
 Under Xi, Chinese authorities have talked a lot about efforts to ""deleverage"" the economy and reduce risk in the financial sector. But banks are still encouraged to lend to unproductive state companies, believing the government will always bail these firms out if they get in trouble, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China specialist at research firm Capital Economics.
 
 ""Firms are being kept alive that wouldn't survive in a free market,"" he said. Xi is seen as reluctant to tackle the problem head on because any collapse in state firms could cause unemployment and financial instability.
 
 If the president emerges more powerful from the Party Congress, some observers suggest he could have more clout to push through tough reforms more quickly. But Evans-Pritchard isn't convinced.
 
 ""Xi has so far shown little desire to reduce the state intervention that underlies these problems,"" he and his colleagues wrote in a recent report. ""We are skeptical that any consolidation of power around Xi will improve the prospects for reforms.""","['companies', 'market', 'whats', 'debt', 'jinping', 'chinese', 'yuan', 'xis', 'chinas', 'economy', 'china', 'xi']",{'China': 17},,,,,

 Representatives from dozens of countries -- including 30 heads of state -- gathered in Beijing on Sunday for a lavish summit to discuss China's trillion-dollar global trade and investment initiative, known as One Belt, One Road.
 
 India, however, was conspicuous by its absence.
 
 The South Asian nation -- the world's fastest growing major economy and Asia's third biggest -- chose not to attend the gathering, where China laid out its plan to connect nearly 70 countries through a series of global trade pacts, inspired by the ancient Silk Road trading route.
 
 Related: Just what is this One Belt, One Road thing anyway?
 
 India's main objection is the partnership China is developing with Pakistan. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a key component of One Belt, One Road -- passes through the disputed region of Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim in its entirety.
 
 ""No country can accept a project that ignores its core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" India's foreign ministry said in a statement Saturday.
 
 The foreign ministry also cited concerns about the ""unsustainable debt burden"" China's partner countries along the route would have to bear.
 
 ""We have been urging China to engage in a meaningful dialogue,"" the Indian statement said. ""We are awaiting a positive response from the Chinese side.""
 
 In an opinion piece published Sunday, China's state-run Global Times said it was ""regrettable"" that India had decided to boycott the event but the project would go ahead, with or without New Delhi's support.
 
 It pointed out that China and Pakistan signed new deals worth $500 million over the weekend, while Nepal -- sandwiched between India and China -- has also formally joined the Belt and Road initiative.

 Despite staying away from the Beijing showcase, India is involved in the Belt and Road initiative.
 
 Outside China, it is the largest stakeholder in the Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and a founding member of the New Development Bank. Both are major funding sources for the new trade route.
 
 It also participates directly via an agreement called the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar economic corridor.
 
 ""It wasn't a very wise decision to boycott [the forum],"" said Swaran Singh, an expert on India-China relations at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.
 
 Singh described the quarrel over Pakistan as ""a fuss"" that would only benefit Beijing and Islamabad.
 
 ""I'm not saying the prime minister should have gone, but we are stakeholders, we are partners...so we should have had some presence,"" he added.
 
 India has some cards to play. India's booming economy and its increasingly affluent middle class of more than 300 million people provide it with growing regional clout.

 ""Both in terms of political endorsement and economic viability, India [attending the event] would have really benefited the Chinese,"" Singh said. ""That's why they tried really hard to get us on board.""

 The dispute is unlikely to hamper the two countries' existing economic cooperation.

 Xi has championed what China formally calls the “One Belt, One Road” or OBOR initiative to build a new Silk Road linking Asia, Africa and Europe, a landmark programme to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure projects including railways, ports and power grids.
 
 China has dedicated $40 billion to a Silk Road Fund and the idea was the driving force behind the establishment of the $50 billion China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
 
 Global friend
 
 While China has portrayed the New Silk Road as a genuine effort to share the bounty of China's economic development and to fund infrastructure gaps, many Western countries are concerned about a lack of detail and transparency in the project and are suspicious about China's broader political intents.
 
 Diplomatic sources said the presence of Putin and other leaders from countries with dubious human rights records, like the Philippines and Central Asian states, had contributed to a reluctance among Western leaders to attend.
 
 “What Western leader wants to sit on the same stage as Putin?” said one senior Beijing-based Western diplomat who is familiar with the planning for the summit, speaking on condition of anonymity.
 
 Still, at a time of uncertainty about the US place in the world following President Donald Trump's pledges to put America first, China sees an opportunity to become more of a global leader and has found a receptive audience for its New Silk Road.
 
 Leaders from countries that would appear to have little, if any, connection to the plan are coming to the summit, including Chile and Argentina.
 
 “Everyone wants to be China's friend now with Trump in office,” said a senior Asian diplomat in Beijing. While China says the New Silk Road is not political, it has run into opposition from India due to a section of it in Pakistan, known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, where some projects run through the disputed Kashmir region.
 
 China has dismissed those concerns, saying CPEC had nothing to do with the dispute and India was welcome to participate in the New Silk Road.","['chief', 'beijing', 'sharif', 'projects', 'minister', 'silk', 'belt', 'attend', 'leaders', 'prime', 'china', 'travel', 'ministers', 'forum', 'road', 'western']","{'Argentina': 1, 'Chile': 1, 'China': 13, 'Hong Kong': 3, 'India': 2, 'Pakistan': 5, 'Philippines': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 “The value of shipping can no longer be determined by scale alone. The ability of the sector to leverage relevant technological advances to improve processes and operations, cut costs and generate value for the industry and customers, as well as the broader economy and society, is becoming increasingly important,” UNCTAD says in its Review of Maritime Transport for 2018.
 
 UNCTAD projections are pointing to continued growth in world seaborne trade, which hinges on continued growth in GDP. At the same time, upside and downside risks to the outlook are manifold and include rising trade tensions on the downside and digitalisation on the upside.
 
 At a time of growing concerns over the rise of protectionist sentiments, barrier to trade and trade disputes that may result in far-reaching detrimental impacts for the global economy and trade should be avoided to the extent possible, suggests the report.
 
 Governments have a role to play by supporting the current positive economic trends and promoting a self-sustaining global economic recovery. This may entail, among other measures, commodity-dependent countries, it says.
 
 According to the report, relevant regulatory authorities, maritime transport analysts, as well as development entities such as UNCTAD need to regularly monitor market concentration trends in liner shipping and assess potential implications in terms of market power, freight rates, surcharges and other costs to shippers and trade.
 
 Governments, in collaboration with the shipping industry, the private sector, and the trade and business community need to build digital preparedness and promote greater uptake of relevant technologies. This will require, among others, providing an enabling legal and regulatory framework and supporting training and initiatives to build knowledge and upgrade skills.
 
 All stakeholders, including governments, need to work together and support the development of transportation and supply chain infrastructure and services tailored for e-commerce.

 However, what is noteworthy is the fact it now seeks to become a global player through its Belt and Road Initiative — an economic superhighway linking continents and cultures with China at the heart of the project.
 
 And as interest from a growing number of countries has shown, the BRI could play a key role in shaping the socioeconomic and sociopolitical future of Eurasia and beyond.
 
 The fact that 37 heads of state and government — including Prime Minister Imran Khan — attended the just concluded second Belt and Road Forum in Beijing proves that a growing number of states are seeking to jump on the BRI bandwagon and grab a slice of the pie.
 
 It is indeed a massive initiative, envisioning an integrated network stretching from the shores of the Pacific to the heart of Europe, while extending to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.
 
 And CPEC is one of the key nodes of this network, reflecting both on the positive Pakistan-China relationship, as well as this country’s potential as a hub for regional trade and commerce.
 
 However, while the BRI may hold immense potential for the regional, and indeed the global, economy, the projects under its umbrella must be transparent, and the benefits mutual to both China and the partner countries.
 
 There have been accusations of Beijing practising ‘debt-trap diplomacy’ by ‘drowning’ partner states in debt.
 
 There is evidence of Sri Lanka having problems with Chinese debt in a port project, while Malaysia under Mahathir Mohamed has renegotiated a rail project with Beijing on reportedly better terms.
 
 To allay fears such, China and partner governments in the BRI must ensure that the terms of the projects involved are clearly understood and transparent.
 
 In Pakistan’s case, there has also been criticism that the benefits of CPEC are not trickling down to all parts of the country. For CPEC to be a success, its fruits must reach all provinces, while Pakistan’s economy must benefit from the project in the long term.
 
 Under the vision of functionalism and regional integration, the dynamics of international relations have been transformed.
 
 For example, from the ashes of old Europe rose the European Union, in which former foes discarded their mutual animosity and worked for unprecedented integration.
 
 However, while the EU project may be facing turbulence, regional cooperation under BRI can — by interlocking economies — be the harbinger of better ties and prosperity for the people of Eurasia and other regions falling under the project’s ambit.
 
 South Asia, for example, can gain from mutually rewarding BRI initiatives. Indeed others, especially the US and its allies, who are mostly critical of the BRI, must let this ambitious vision become a reality and work to establish a complementary relationship.

 BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Saturday $64 billion in deals were signed at a summit on his Belt and Road Initiative and more nations would join the global infrastructure programme as he sought to ease concerns over the colossal project.
 
 Xi and 37 world leaders wrapped up a three-day forum in Beijing with pledges to ensure that projects on the new Silk Road are green and financially sustainable following concerns about debt and environmental damage.
 
 “We are committed to supporting open, clean and green development and rejecting protectionism,” Xi told journalists at the end of the forum, without taking questions.
 
 His signature foreign policy aims to reinvent the ancient Silk Road to connect Asia to Europe and Africa through massive investments in maritime, road and rail projects -- with hundreds of billions of dollars in financing from Chinese banks.
 
 But critics say the six-year-old project is a plan to boost Beijing’s global influence, riddled with opaque deals favouring Chinese companies and saddling nations with debt and environmental damage. The US, India and some European nations have looked at the project with suspicion. Washington did not send any representatives to the meeting.
 
 “This year’s forum sends a clear message: more and more friends and partners will join in the Belt and Road co-operation,” Xi said.
 
 A document released after the meeting showed that Equatorial Guinea, Liberia, Luxembourg, Jamaica, Peru, Italy, Barbados, Cyprus and Yemen were the latest countries to join the club.
 
 Xi said enterprises will be the main driver in all Belt and Road projects and market principles will apply, with governments providing a supporting role.
 
 “This will make the projects more sustainable and create a fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign investors,” Xi said.
 
 Xi said that business leaders meeting at a side event signed some $64 billion worth of deals during the forum, without providing details.
 
 At the picturesque Yanqi Lake outside Beijing, leaders from Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America gathered to issue a joint communique.
 
 The gathering included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, whose nation became the first G7 member to join Belt and Road, and Pakistan’s Imran Khan.
 
 Project sustainability
 
 The massive projects, financed mainly through Chinese bank loans and investments, have raised concerns that poorer countries are being saddled with debt — Sri Lanka turned over a deep-sea port to China for 99 years after it was unable to repay loans.
 
 A communique released at the end of the meeting said leaders encouraged multilateral development banks and other international financial institutions to support projects “in fiscally sustainable ways” and mobilise private capital in line with local needs.
 
 “We emphasise the importance of economic, social, fiscal, financial and environmental sustainability of projects,” it said.
 
 The draft communique says BRI will welcome developed countries and international investors to participate in the projects.
 
 “Faced with this rising resistance for the past year and a half and this debt image ... China is trying to reposition (BRI) and send a reassuring message,” said Nadege Rolland, a senior fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research, a US-based think tank.
 
 But “let’s see how it is put into practice”, she said.
 
 China’s finance ministry released guidelines Thursday for assessing financial risk and debt sustainability to apply to projects in BRI countries.
 
 But the document notes that countries already facing payment problems or in the process of restructuring payments “does not automatically mean that debt is unsustainable in a forward-looking sense”.
 
 ‘Civilised and soft’
 
 Beijing also published a list Saturday of 283 “deliverables” that bore the Belt and Road brand name, including agreements between museums and art festivals, and even cooperation on space — a clear sign that BRI is a major soft power tool for China as well.
 
 Russian President Vladimir Putin praised China for acting in a “civilised and soft manner” and he took a veiled swipe at the United States.

 A document released after the meeting showed that Equatorial Guinea, Liberia, Luxembourg, Jamaica, Peru, Italy, Barbados, Cyprus and Yemen were the latest countries to join the club.
 
 Xi said enterprises will be the main driver in all Belt and Road projects and market principles will apply, with governments providing a supporting role.
 
 “This will make the projects more sustainable and create a fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign investors,” Xi said.
 
 Xi said that business leaders meeting at a side event signed some $64 billion worth of deals during the forum, without providing details.
 
 At the picturesque Yanqi Lake outside Beijing, leaders from Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America gathered to issue a joint communique.
 
 The gathering included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, whose nation became the first G7 member to join Belt and Road, and Pakistan's Imran Khan.
 
 Project 'sustainability
 
 The massive projects, financed mainly through Chinese bank loans and investments, have raised concerns that poorer countries are being saddled with debt — Sri Lanka turned over a deep-sea port to China for 99 years after it was unable to repay loans.
 
 A communique released at the end of the meeting said leaders encouraged multilateral development banks and other international financial institutions to support projects “in fiscally sustainable ways” and mobilise private capital in line with local needs.
 
 “We emphasise the importance of economic, social, fiscal, financial and environmental sustainability of projects,” it said.
 
 The draft communique says BRI will welcome developed countries and international investors to participate in the projects.
 
 “Faced with this rising resistance for the past year and a half and this debt image ... China is trying to reposition (BRI) and send a reassuring message,” said Nadege Rolland, a senior fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research, a US-based think tank.
 
 But “let's see how it is put into practice”, she said.
 
 China's finance ministry released guidelines on Thursday for assessing financial risk and debt sustainability to apply to projects in BRI countries.
 
 But the document notes that countries already facing payment problems or in the process of restructuring payments “does not automatically mean that debt is unsustainable in a forward-looking sense”.
 
 'Civilised and soft'
 
 Beijing also published a list on Saturday of 283 “deliverables” that bore the Belt and Road brand name, including agreements between museums and art festivals, and even cooperation on space — a clear sign that BRI is a major soft power tool for China as well.
 
 Russian President Vladimir Putin praised China for acting in a “civilised and soft manner” and he took a veiled swipe at the United States.
 
 “Nobody wants sanctions, nobody wants trade wars, except those who start them. These sanctions harm the world economy,” Putin said, adding that China “currently defends liberal values”.
 
 BRI projects have faced pushback in some countries. In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cancelled some planned works and renegotiated a rail project, cutting 30 percent off the price tag.
 
 But Mahathir and other leaders attending the summit had fulsome praise for BRI.","['initiative', 'countries', 'projects', 'joining', 'debt', 'chinese', 'belt', 'leaders', 'nations', 'president', 'china', 'bri', 'xi', 'join', 'road']","{'Barbados': 1, 'China': 6, 'Cyprus': 1, 'Guinea': 1, 'Equatorial Guinea': 1, 'India': 1, 'Italy': 1, 'Jamaica': 1, 'Liberia': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'Luxembourg': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Peru': 1, 'United States': 3, 'Yemen': 1}",,,,,

 While addressing a leaders' round table conference in China, the prime minister congratulated President Xi Jinping on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China and said that China is an example of ""a great success of the modern age"".
 
 He suggested that members of the BRI should:
 
 Establish a BRI Tourism Corridor for cultural and tourism exchanges.
 
 Develop programmes for improving the skills of labour from labour-surplus countries to assist the labour-deficient countries.
 
 Create multi-lingual digital platforms for connecting producers, consumers, and skilled job-seekers.
 
 While explaining to the members of the conference the ties Pakistan and China have cultivated through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he said that ""to further boost connectivity and benefits under the Belt Road Initiative's umbrella"" digital connectivity amongst member countries is key.
 
 The other areas stressed by the premier to strengthen the ties formed through the BRI included mobility of labour, cultivation of cultural links and connectivity through knowledge and innovation.
 
 Imran said the connectivity of Gwadar Port with China’s Xinjiang region will ""provide a shorter route for China’s imports compared to the South China Sea, reduce the cost for Chinese companies, and develop western China as well"".
 
 He emphasised that ""CPEC is not a transaction. It is a transformation of our society.""
 
 Along with a Pakistani delegation, the premier also met with Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan today. On behalf of President Xi Jinping, the vice president hosted a banquet for PM Imran and the Pakistani delegation.
 
 On Friday, in his speech at the inaugural session of the second Belt and Road Forum (BRF) in Beijing, Prime Minister Imran had said: “As the Belt and Road Initiative takes a further concrete shape, I suggest we direct our efforts and focus on the peoples of our countries, and towards addressing impediments on their way to sustainable growth”.
 
 Prime Minister Imran is among the 37 heads of state and government participating in the second edition of BRF, which is a platform for BRI partners to come together for reviewing their cooperation under the programme and charting the roadmap for future. As many as 122 states and 49 international organisations are part of Chinese BRI.
 
 The five-point action plan proposed by the prime minister included joint efforts for mitigating climate change, establishing a BRI tourism corridor for promoting people-to-people contacts and inter-cultural understanding, setting up an office of anti-corruption cooperation, creating a poverty alleviation fund, and further liberalising trade and investment flows by encouraging private sector and businesses to collaborate in projects.
 
 Prime Minister Imran's proposals reflected Pakistan government’s priorities and he recalled his administration’s massive tree plantation drive and efforts for alleviating poverty, including the launch of the Ehsas programme. Some of the proposals also reflected Chinese priorities as Beijing seeks to enhance the ‘quality of cooperation’ under the BRI.","['countries', 'corridor', 'calls', 'minister', 'creation', 'imran', 'tourism', 'president', 'prime', 'china', 'bri', 'road']","{'China': 9, 'Pakistan': 5}",,,,,

 The long-delayed report said that the Belt and Road — a string of ports, railways, roads and bridges and other investments connecting China to Europe via central and southern Asia — could lift 32 million people out of moderate poverty conditions if implemented fully.
 
 Still, there are “significant risks,” the World Bank said.
 
 “Achieving the ambitions of the Belt and Road Initiative will require equally ambitious reforms from participating countries,” World Bank Vice President for Equitable Growth Ceyla Pazarbasioglu said in a statement.
 
 “Improvements in data reporting and transparency — especially around debt — open government procurement, and adherence to the highest social and environmental standards will help significantly,” she added.
 
 World Bank President David Malpass skipped China’s second Belt and Road summit in Beijing in April to take his first foreign trip to Africa instead. Malpass was a critic of Belt and Road when he was an official at the US Department of the Treasury, arguing that it was saddling some countries with unsustainable debts.
 
 The report found that for some countries, the costs of new infrastructure could outweigh potential economic gains and the benefits would be unevenly distributed among participating countries.
 
 Real income gains in the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and Thailand could be above eight per cent, but Azerbaijan, Mongolia and Tajikistan could experience negative welfare gains due to high infrastructure costs, the analysis showed.
 
 The World Bank said real income for Belt and Road corridor economies could be two to four times larger if they ease trade restrictions and institute reforms to reduce border delays.
 
 Increased private-sector participation in Belt and Road, now dominated by China’s state-owned banks and enterprises, can help sustain the initiative in the long run, but participating countries would need to institute reforms to improve their investment climates, including stronger legal protections and regulations, the report said.
 
 “Little is known about the processes for selecting firms” for Belt and Road projects, the report said. “Moving toward international good practices such as open and transparent public procurement would increase the likelihood that BRI projects are allocated to the firms best placed to implement them.”
 
 There was also a need to increase transparency of debt terms and conditions for Belt and Road projects to allow governments to assess the risks to their ability to sustain debt, the report said.

 The policy championed by Chinese President Xi Jinping has become mired in controversy, with some partner nations bemoaning the high cost of projects, though China has repeatedly said it is not seeking to trap anyone with debt.
 
 Western governments have tended to view it as a means to spread Chinese influence abroad, saddling poor countries with unsustainable debt.
 
 Finance Minister Liu Kun, speaking at a forum to kick off a three-day Belt and Road summit in Beijing, said China will establish an analysis framework on debt sustainability for Belt and Road projects to “prevent and resolve debt risks”.
 
 Chinese financial institutions, countries involved in Belt and Road and international agencies are encouraged to use this framework to enhance debt management, Liu said.
 
 While most of the Belt and Road projects are continuing as planned, some have been caught up by changes in government in countries such as Malaysia and the Maldives.
 
 Those that have been shelved for financial reasons include a power plant in Pakistan and an airport in Sierra Leone, and Beijing has in recent months had to rebuff critics by saying that not one country has been burdened with so-called “debt traps”.
 
 Yi Gang, China’s central bank governor, said at the same event that local currencies will be used for investments related to the Belt and Road plan to curb exchange rate risks.
 
 China will follow market principles and rely on commercial funds for Belt and Road financing, Yi said, adding that China will improve transparency for those projects.
 
 “We should strengthen debt and risk management. We should objectively and fully understand debt problems of developing countries,” he added.
 
 “Investment decisions should ... effectively control risks and fully consider a country’s overall debt capacity and ensure debt is sustainable.” In a nod to debt concerns, a draft communique seen by Reuters said that 37 world leaders attending the summit will agree to project financing that respects global debt goals and promotes green growth.
 
 Quality over quantity
 
 Chinese government officials and heads of state-owned enterprises such as China National Petroleum Corp and China Communications Construction Corp told a separate forum that they would pay more attention to environmental conservation and protection.
 
 They also pledged to undertake higher quality projects that would hire more local staff and respond to the needs of recipient countries.
 
 Jose Vinals, chairman of Standard Chartered Bank, said at the forum he hoped to see the initiative focus more on quality and multilateralism, saying that many projects remained bilateral in the sense that they involved the Chinese government and firms dealing directly with recipient countries.
 
 More opportunities have to be given to other countries as well as the private sector to play a role, he said, adding that bilateral engagement tended to have less transparency and lower levels of governance, which in turn could affect the quality of projects.
 
 “It is very important to emphasise project quality over project quantity,” he said.
 
 Visiting leaders will be headlined by Russia’s Vladimir Putin, as well as Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan, a close China ally and among the biggest recipients of Belt and Road investment, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, which recently became the first G7 country to sign on to the initiative.
 
 The United States, which has not joined the Belt and Road, is expected to send only lower-level officials, and nobody from Washington, citing concerns over opaque financing practices, poor governance, and disregard for internationally accepted norms.

 Abbasi said Pakistan is the most visible part of the BRI because of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and that the project would result in freer movement of people and greater cultural interaction between the countries, Radio Pakistan reported.
 
 Referring to CPEC, which is part of BRI, the prime minister said projects under the initiative include power plants, highways, modernisation of railways and ports, construction of airports and setting up of economic zones for export growth.
 
 Editorial: OBOR connectivity shunned
 
 The results of CPEC related projects have already started appearing as our cement plants produced 56 percent additional capacity and exports grew by 15 per cent, Abbasi was quoted as saying.
 
 He said CPEC is also boosting confidence of the investors and Pakistan is getting a lot of investment in addition to CPEC. ""Apart from financial sustainability, these projects are indicative of Pakistan being a more responsible global citizen as far as environment is concerned,"" he said.
 
 The prime minister said the development of ports and highways, Pakistan can provide much more efficient connectivity to most of Central Asian countries, which are landlocked.

 Abbasi reportedly thanked and appreciated the support provided by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to Pakistan, particularly for the Polio Eradication Programme. He discussed avenues of partnership in health, education and other social sectors with Gates.

It is, therefore, quite appropriate to ask hard questions about the financing and affordability of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and to which country will accrue the majority of gains in the years and decades ahead.
 
 At the same time, it is necessary to acknowledge that CPEC is only one plank, an important one no doubt, of the vast One Belt, One Road project that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made the centrepiece of his rule — a developmental and an infrastructure-building spree on a scale that the world has not seen since the end of the Second World War.
 
 While the US, architect of the current global economic and political order, has fretted that OBOR amounts to China’s first attempt to redraw the global order, there is an undeniable opportunity at the heart of the venture.
 
 If engaged with sensibly and pragmatically, OBOR could help all of China’s trading partners and regional neighbours, big and small, realise collective gains. That makes India’s decision to boycott the OBOR summit all the more puzzling. Even the US and Japan sent delegations to the summit in Beijing.
 
 Explore: Is India trying to convince the world China’s OBOR plan is secretly colonial?
 
 The Indian foreign ministry’s official reasons for declining to participate are contradictory. Citing India’s own Act East, Neighbourhood First and Go West policies, the ministry spokesperson has claimed that connectivity is at the heart of Indian foreign policy.
 
 But the spokesperson has rejected that very connectivity through OBOR on the pretext of debt traps and financial responsibility — a bizarre form of diplomacy where India appears to believe that it is better placed to interpret the national interest of third countries and the sovereign decisions they are making than those countries themselves.
 
 Even the objection to CPEC because of the claim that the Gilgit-Baltistan region is integral to the Kashmir issue is self-defeating; CPEC is only a part of OBOR, which has already drawn in virtually all of India’s neighbours.
 
 It is as if India believes that by ignoring OBOR, it can thwart its vast effects on the region. In reality, even the most cautious cooperative approach by India could yield significant benefits for both India and the region.
 
 From a Pakistan-centric approach too, the Indian approach makes little sense. As the relationship between China and India itself has shown, trade and economic cooperation can reduce political tensions and create enough incentives for long-term disputes to not turn into open conflict. If OBOR succeeds even to a small extent, it could draw the wider region into a virtuous cycle of trade and prosperity that could cause the spectre of conflict among the region’s three major military powers to recede.
 
 Perhaps India sees itself as a global power to rival China eventually, but that does not mean it should spurn sensible opportunities in the interim. India should reconsider its stance on OBOR.

But despite the enormity of the project, which will include investments estimated at $900 billion to develop new land and maritime trade routes between China and Europe, Beijing’s most populous neighbour was conspicuous by its absence.
 
 Explaining its decision to stay away, the Indian government released a statement saying it is concerned about China’s attitude towards territorial sovereignty and financial responsibility.
 
 “We are of firm belief that connectivity initiatives must be based on universally recognised international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality... Connectivity projects must be pursued in a manner that respects sovereignty and territorial integrity.
 
 ...Guided by our principled position in the matter, we have been urging China to engage in a meaningful dialogue on its connectivity initiative, ‘One Belt, One Road’ which was later renamed as ‘Belt and Road Initiative’. We are awaiting a positive response from the Chinese side.” — Ministry of External Affairs
 
 The Times of India condensed this to a simple phrase that would easily resonate with Indians, saying New Delhi’s strongly worded statement suggested that the Belt and Road project “is little more than a colonial enterprise, leaving debt and broken communities in its wake”.
 
 China-Pakistan corridor
 
 India’s statement is generally being read as a direct response to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a $62 billion package of infrastructure projects considered one of the flagship parts of the Belt and Road initiative.
 
 The CPEC connects China’s western Xinjiang province with Gwadar port, while also giving Pakistan access to other Central Asian nations. But a significant portion of the corridor runs through what New Delhi calls Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
 
 This has constantly caused heartburn in relations between New Delhi and Beijing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a reference to the CPEC at the Raisina Dialogue in January, saying “only by respecting the sovereignty of countries involved, can regional connectivity corridors fulfill their promise and avoid differences and discord.”
 
 Saturday’s statement from the Ministry of External Affairs about the Belt and Road Initiative reiterated this.
 
 “Regarding the so-called ‘China-Pakistan Economic Corridor’, which is being projected as the flagship project of the BRI/OBOR, the international community is well aware of India’s position. No country can accept a project that ignores its core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
 
 Colonial China
 
 While the references to CPEC and sovereignty are to be expected, Saturday’s statement included objections that go beyond questions of territory.
 
 “Connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities; balanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards; transparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to help long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local communities.”
 
 India has always insisted on referring to OBOR as a “unilateral” or “national” project of China’s rather than a regional, multilateral one. Indian Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar said in 2015 that OBOR is a “national initiative devised with national interests,” and that if China wanted India to buy into it, they would “need to have larger discussions and those haven’t happened.”
 
 References to financial responsibility, environmental protection, transparency and technology transfer now expand on this idea with a more specific critique.
 
 With the CPEC, India wanted China to know that it is miffed about the initiative intruding on disputed territory. With the new references, it seems like it is trying to convince countries that are party to OBOR that getting close to China might be a bad idea.
 
 Debt diplomacy
 
 This is not new. Analysts have for some time warned that Beijing’s massive initiative is essentially aimed at helping China transition from a manufacturing nation into a consumer economy, get rid of excess capacity, reduce the disparity between its western and eastern provinces and, most importantly, project Chinese geostrategic power throughout the neighbourhood and beyond.
 
 Foreign policy analyst Brahma Chellaney called the OBOR China’s “debt-trap diplomacy”, arguing that it intentionally puts partner countries in debt to increase Beijing’s leverage.
 
 Ratings agency Fitch warned in a report earlier this year that OBOR does not address the most pressing infrastructure needs of partner countries and could easily result in unviable projects and smaller nations saddled with large debts.
 
 There have already been examples of this. In Sri Lanka, China helped build a large port and airport near Hambantota but with little economic activity emerging from either project, the loans are mounting and that debt is turning into equity, giving Beijing more control over key assets on the island country. Analysts in Cambodia have raised red flags suggesting the same thing might happen there.
 
 Seema Sirohi, writing in the Economic Times, goes further, calling OBOR “not globalisation 2.0 but dominance 3.0”. New Delhi now appears to be taking this line too.
 
 Too little too late
 
 Yet it is important to also note that almost every large country in the world, apart from India, was already at the table in Beijing. Even the United States of America, which initially planned to snub Beijing, sent representatives after China said it would open its market to American beef. The same applied to India’s neighbourhood. Every one of India’s neighbours, barring Bhutan, had a delegation at the Belt and Road Forum.
 
 Never mind questions about what India’s own connectivity efforts have amounted to, whether it is the Spice Route or Project Mausam, the Indian Ocean-focused SAGAR or New Delhi’s inability to keep even Bhutan in a road project connecting the neighbourhood.
 
 The last-minute statement from MEA suggests negotiations for India to turn up at the Belt and Road Forum failed, as have most other attempts to connect with Beijing recently – whether it is keeping India out of the Nuclear Suppliers Group or in preventing Masood Azhar from being declared a global terrorist.
 
 India might be attempting a face-saver in bringing up questions of finances and transparency with OBOR, but it is unlikely to convince anyone beyond a domestic audience, at least for the moment.
 
 But MEA seems to have finally made its position on OBOR clear. What will snubbing China, India’s largest trading partner, mean for events in a region that is already tense?

 Chinese acquisitions in the 68 countries officially linked to President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign policy totalled $33 billion as of Monday, surpassing the $31bn tally for all of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.
 
 Unveiled in 2013, the Belt and Road project is aimed at building a modern-day “Silk Road,” connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Central Asia, and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
 
 At a summit in May, Xi pledged $124bn for the plan, but it has faced suspicion in Western capitals that it is intended more to assert Chinese influence than Beijing’s professed desire to spread prosperity.
 
 The surge in Chinese companies’ acquisition-linked investments in the Belt and Road corridor comes as the volume of all outbound mergers and acquisitions from China has dropped 42 per cent year-on-year as of Monday, the Thomson Reuters data showed.
 
 Beijing’s move to prop up the yuan by restricting the flow of capital outside the country and clamp down on debt-fuelled acquisitions to ensure financial stability has made it tougher for buyers to win approvals for deals abroad.
 
 Regulators have tightened the screws further since June, reviewing deal agreements in minute detail and ordering a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by several big companies that have been on overseas buying sprees, including HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group and Fosun Group.
 
 The heightened regulatory scrutiny of overseas acquisitions comes after companies spent a record $220bn in 2016 on assets overseas, buying up everything from movie studios to European football clubs.

 BEIJING: Two-way investment between China and economies related to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) exceeded $130 billion between 2013 and 2018, injecting new growth momentum into BRI-related countries and contributing to recovery of the global economy, senior Chinese officials said on Monday.
 
 China’s direct investment in BRI-related countries grew 5.2% annually on average to surpass $90 billion between 2013 and 2018, Song Lihong, an official in the Ministry of Commerce’s Comprehensive Department said at a news conference. Song said in the same period, China had received a total of $40 billion in inbound investment from BRI countries as two-way investment deepened.
 
 Within the five years, the value of the projects completed by Chinese companies in BRI economies was calculated at $400 billion, Song said.
 
 The value of trade in goods between China and BRI-related economies exceeded $6 trillion in the same period, an average annual growth of 4%, higher than the overall growth of China’s foreign trade, he added. Regarding the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, to be held in Beijing from Thursday through Saturday, Song said the commerce ministry would help deepen economic and trade cooperation with other countries.
 
 “China will build more free trade zones with countries that are willing to do so,” Song added. “As for the existing free trade zones, we will reduce administrative barriers to trade and investment and push the formation of a big Belt and Road marketplace.”
 
 While some critics have argued that the initiative will lead countries into debt traps, Song said the debt issue could be solved through joint efforts to promote the development of BRI economies.
 
 “Even though some countries may have high debt levels, as their pace of industrialisation, urbanisation and modernisation accelerates, their debts will gradually decrease.”
 
 Siemens AG CEO and President Joe Kaeser said, “If an initiative like the BRI unifies more than two-thirds of the global population, it will create massive infrastructure and economic movement that will build its own rules.”
 
 He said from a long-term perspective, population determines economic growth. Even though it will take some time, the large number of people in BRI-related economies will ultimately prove the potential for economic development in those countries.

 The second Summit on China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), held in Beijing from April 26 to 27 and attended by several world leaders from more than 150 countries, provided an opportunity to showcase China’s mega project aimed at promoting global growth and prosperity.
 
 But critics, led by the US, used the occasion to castigate the BRI as a manifestation of China’s “geo-political ambitions” that would force developing countries into a “debt trap”. At the heart of this controversy is whether the BRI is a benign Chinese endeavour to promote greater international connectivity for shared economic development or a tool to dominate Asian, African and Latin American countries. This issue is of paramount importance for Pakistan since CPEC is the flagship project of the BRI and an example to be emulated by other developing countries. Therefore, the BRI needs to be placed in its true context.
 
 Unveiled by President Xi in 2013, “as a foreign policy priority”, the BRI seeks to “revive and reinvigorate the ancient Silk Roads that connected China with Eurasia. To actualise this initiative, China set up development oriented financial institutions and planning mechanisms to accelerate the construction of infrastructure connecting China with neighbouring regions and build a “Silk Road Economic Belt and a Maritime Silk road to form a new pattern of all-around opportunities”.
 
 The China Development Bank alone earmarked nearly one trillion US dollars by 2015 for over 900 projects involving transportation, infrastructure and energy. The Chinese Export-Import Bank pledged financing for more than 1,000 projects in 49 countries as part of the BRI. The total Chinese financial outlay is estimated at about three trillion dollars. Today over 80 countries are directly part of this initiative while scores of others, including several members of the EU, are also involved. These countries spread from and across Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America — a total of around 63 per cent of the world’s population with a collective total of over 21 trillion dollars of global output.
 
 Guided by China’s policy of “harmonious rise” to superpower status and “win-win cooperation” with partnering countries, President Xi has maintained that “exchange will replace estrangement”; “mutual learning will replace clashes” and “coexistence will replace a sense of superiority”. More pointedly Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that “the BRI is not a geo-political tool but a platform for cooperation”.
 
 The BRI grand design is unprecedented in scale but not unique. Such linkages have been suggested before. In the aftermath of the Iraq invasion, American officials spoke of their goal to “revive ancient ties between South and Central Asia…to create new links in the areas of trade, transport, democracy, energy and communications”.
 
 Later, in 2011, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton proposed creating a “new Silk Road — an international network of economic and transit connections”. But these proved to be mere statements of intent rather than substantive policies backed up by financial commitments.
 
 More recently, Trump’s Secretary of State Pompeo announced an enhanced US regional role in the “Indo-Pacific” as “one of the greatest engines of the global economy” for which he announced 113 million dollars in new initiatives, a minuscule amount compared to China’s trillion dollars investments.
 
 The reality is that a declining US, and under Trump an unreliable partner to boot, does not carry the same influence as a rising China. Unable to compete in the global marketplace, the US has resorted to building pressure against China.
 
 Instead of accepting China (and Russia) as equal partners to evolve a new stable international order, the US has resorted to building military alliances and trade wars to contain and confront China. A key part of this strategy is to demonise China as a “predatory state” that is using the BRI to entrap poor countries through increasing their debt burden. American-dominated international financial institutions like the IMF and the World Bank are being used to spread such allegations.
 
 But this canard has been exposed by objective Americans themselves. For example, of the overall debt for African countries, estimated by the China-Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University amounting to 143 billion dollars, the majority of this debt is owed to non-Chinese lenders mainly Western banks.
 
 The total debt of Latin American countries, according to the Global Development Policy Centre, “financing from China alone did not appear to be driving borrowers above the IMF’s debt sustainability threshold”. Similarly, the controversy generated about Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port which was allegedly surrendered to China due to non-payable debts of 46 billion dollars, it was revealed that actually only 10 per cent of the debt is owed to China. In short, according to these analysts, as reported in The New York Times of April 27, “fears that China is deliberately preying on countries in need are unfounded”.
 
 Pakistan’s own example is a case in point. While Secretary Pompeo fulminated that the US will not allow the IMF to bail out Pakistan so that it could pay off its Chinese loans, the fact remains that over 80 per cent of Pakistan’s debt is owed to Western lenders including the US and IMF, not to China.
 
 Aside from the debt burden argument, the US has resorted to a massive disinformation and destabilisation campaign within Pakistan through its proxies and touts to mislead Pakistanis about CPEC. It has also enlisted its Indian acolytes to oppose CPEC, by promoting terrorism through the BLA and the TTP, such as attacks on Chinese workers and the Chinese Consulate in Karachi. In this effort, the Gwadar port has also been projected as a Chinese naval base rather than what it actually is — a commercial port for trading and trans-shipment purposes.
 
 Undoubtedly, in any project the size of the BRI, there will be shortcomings which President Xi acknowledged at the recent Summit, calling for transparency and zero tolerance for corruption. But to argue that the BRI is a geo-political power grab by China to challenge the US belies its real purpose and exposes America’s own vulnerabilities in a changing world order.

 Pakistan is confronted with challenges of many types, but with a new government in the saddle now, there are renewed hopes for the country to overcome all its challenges. In July 2018, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, a relatively smaller political party, won the general election. Led by former cricket hero Imran Khan, the party has started implementing his vision for a ‘Naya Pakistan’ to make the country diplomatically significant, economically strong and socially thriving and peaceful. Towards this end, the incumbent government has taken a number of steps. To start with, the new government is making huge efforts to overcome the economic crisis, successfully making arrangements for financial assistance from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, China and recently, Qatar, and reaching an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic bailout package. Other ways of economic rehabilitation include boosting exports, attracting foreign investment, providing training to the workforce, sending workers overseas, and promoting tourism. Reforms are also on their way in social and educational aspects, and in public health. Anatol Lieven discusses in his book Pakistan, a Hard Country that many competent officials educated in the United Kingdom provide strength to the Pakistani government; and its capability to recover from the various crises, such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks, proves the country’s resilience. Following through with the government’s agenda to create a corruption-free Pakistan, the country’s top accountability watchdog called the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) is pursuing corruption cases even against top politicians, including former prime ministers, one of whom stood convicted and jailed. A significant number of high-ranking officials have also been investigated and arrested.
 
 Pakistan has, however, many obstacles to overcome, toughest of them being tackling terrorism and settling disputes with India. Moreover, Pakistan’s geopolitical location – besides being a gift – is a challenge as well. The country is situated at the crossroads of the hegemonic rivalry between the Indo-Pacific Strategy presented by the US and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) put forth by China. A recent opinion piece in The Financial Times has expressed concern over Pakistan’s excessive reliance on China, especially with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects booming a part of the BRI. Besides, thriving economies in neighbouring India and Bangladesh must be a point to ponder for Pakistan. The economic growth of India has increased by around 7% in recent years. This trend is expected to continue, partly as Prime Minister Modi – who won the general election last May – would do everything to capitalise on the economic success achieved during his previous tenure. Besides, India aims to stand along with the United States and China as one of the biggest economies in the world in the near future. The economic situation in Bangladesh is also charming, with the economic growth rate well placed at 7%. In his book The End of Poverty, Jeffery Sachs has analysed that Bangladesh has already put its first step on the ladder out of poverty in 2005. This brings us to a question: while the two countries in the Indian subcontinent are progressing, will Pakistan follow suit?
 
 Well, South Korea is genuinely hopeful! That’s why with the ‘Naya Pakistan’ of Prime Minister Imran Khan, South Korean companies have been collaborating in multiple projects. Lotte Group has been investing in various fields in the country such as chemicals, confectionary and beverage manufacture as well as engineering and construction. Also, the first highway connecting Islamabad and Lahore, the M2, had been built by a Korea company in 1997. More recently, Korean companies have constructed a few hydroelectric power plants in Pakistan, and plan to build four to five more. Korean enterprises are pursuing further cooperation in the fields of railway transportation, Information Technology, agriculture, education, and public health. To quote an instance, when I visited Balochistan in November last, the Chief Minister of the province had showed keen interest in learning from Korea’s cage fishing technology for implementation in his province. Moreover, I read an article about how in Pakistan, death sentence rulings are often withdrawn for lack of sufficient evidence, which means there is an opportunity to employ more advanced criminal forensic techniques where Korean cooperation can be of great help.
 
 Korea and Pakistan share a history of economic hardship. In the last 50 years, Korea has shown economic growth and achieved democratisation through hard struggles. Likewise, Pakistan is expected to experience great economic growth over the next few decades. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers’ longer-term view of global economic prospects, Pakistan’s economy is forecasted to rank at 20th in 2030, and at 16th in 2050, surpassing that of Korea. Pakistan will perhaps walk a similar path as Korea has trodden and is calling out for cooperation with Korea. Now is the time for Korea to proactively respond to it.

 The positive vibes generated by Prime Minister Imran Khan’s maiden visit to the United States from July 21 to 23 are still being discussed both in Washington and Islamabad. While Imran hailed Trump’s ‘vision’ for the region in a recent high-powered meeting to review the outcome of his trip to Washington, President Donlad Trump also spoke about his ‘excellent’ interaction with the Pakistani prime minister.
 
 The Trump-Imran apparent bonhomie has given many a reason to believe that both Pakistan and the US can still stitch together a cooperative relationship despite many divergences and mistrust. The issue that brought the two estranged allies once again on one platform is of course the Afghan endgame. The Trump administration, desperate to save some pride after 18 years of failed efforts to bring some semblance of stability in Afghanistan, is looking up to Pakistan for a bailout.
 
 But Imran’s visit was not just about Afghanistan. The two countries are also discussing other areas of cooperation such as trade and business ties. Trump himself spoke about increasing trade to manifolds with Pakistan. There is no official word nor will anyone publicly say it but there are speculations that the Trump administration is ready to offer a ‘lucrative deal’ to Pakistan in return for rethink on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
 
 Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who complemented Saudi efforts in securing the White House invitation for Imran, is lobbying for free trade deal to Pakistan if it helps the US in bringing peace in Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which already extended financial assistance to Pakistan, will pump in further investments in the country. But for that to happen, Pakistan may have to adjust its current foreign policy priorities particularly towards China.
 
 The US opposition to China’s ‘Belt and Road’ initiative (BRI) is well known. Alice Wells, senior State Department official, told a group of journalists in Islamabad in April that the “US welcomes the infrastructure investment by China and by all countries so far it advances the prosperity of the countries involved.” The larger objective behind America’s opposition to BRI is to stop the rise of China as global power.
 
 Of late there has been a debate in Pakistan that whether CPEC is mutually beneficial for the country. Those who take a critical view of CPEC claim that contracts signed with the Chinese companies were not favorable to Pakistan. On top of that the PM’s US visit has set off speculations that Pakistan may rebalance its ties with China. There was no official confirmation of this possible policy shift but it can’t be ruled out given how Pakistan often makes somersaults on the foreign policy front. There were many instances where Pakistan simply went for a short-term gain but lost sight of the bigger picture. We must learn from our history. Our policy of choosing sides in foreign relations has always come back to haunt us. The major flaw in our foreign policy has always been putting all eggs in one basket. When China announced billions of dollars of investment under CPEC few years back, we were boasting our ‘strategic partnership’ to tell the West, particularly the US, that we no more needed your support.
 
 Now that the US has extended a “hand of friendship” to Pakistan, our romance with Washington is suddenly reignited. There is no point in getting blown away by Trump’s “charm offensive”. The government or the ones in charge of Pakistan’s foreign policy should avoid committing the past mistakes.
 
 Reengagement with the US is certainly a positive development but that doesn’t mean Pakistan has to antagonise China. Pakistan can optimally use its geostrategic location to its advantage by maintaining friendly ties with both China and the US while without becoming a party to their power politics. It is certainly a difficult task but not an impossible one.

Since India already pulled out of the summit, citing concerns over CPEC, prime minister took the opportunity to point out that the project must not be politicised and should be taken as an opportunity for the uplift of the whole region.
 
 Keeping the regional view in perspective, the remarks from Chinese President Xi Jinping have further supported the stance of Pakistan, as India refused to send an official delegation to Beijing, reflecting displeasure with China for developing a trade corridor through Pakistan that also crosses the disputed territory of Kashmir.
 
 With 29 nations along with secretary general of the United Nations, heads of the International Monetary Fund and the Word Bank participating in the forum and some of the major countries like the United Kingdom putting their all-out support behind China’s initiative, India cannot stay out of this for long. It can take the lead from Germany, whose representatives backed the initiative but wanted discussions on certain economic issues to allay any fears.
 
 With the announcement of an extra $100 billion commitment towards the project, the commitment of China is clear. But one common concern shared by some of the participating countries has been the transparency of the project to provide a fair ground for everyone. China has maintained that to sustain the projects, Belt and Road nations should allow companies to play a key role as government resources are limited. But to gain the confidence of regional as well as targeted markets like Europe, there is a need to remove any ambiguities to allay the concerns of participating countries like Germany.
 
 Lastly, for Pakistan and India, it all comes down to the Kashmir issue, the main hurdle between India joining the OBOR initiative. With Pakistan betting on the project for an economic turn-around in the region, the Kashmir issue needs to be resolved if Pakistan has the reap benefits from OBOR and CPEC. The only way forward is resumption of dialogue. With more and more countries joining the project, India should reconsider its stance to take advantage of the immense economic opportunities. CPEC holds the potential to boost the South Asian region, and it must not be held hostage to issues that can be resolved. Pakistan has invited the regional countries to join the project. Now the ball is in India’s court, whether it decides to continue with its reactionary approach or decides to find a way forward. *","['countries', 'region', 'belt', 'regional', 'economic', 'pakistan', 'summit', 'india', 'participating', 'stance', 'cpec', 'road', 'project']","{'China': 5, 'Germany': 2, 'United Kingdom': 1, 'India': 7, 'Pakistan': 7}",,,,,

 The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is certainly a mega project for the Eurasian region. Its timing is of great economic significance. With the global economy still working towards overcoming economic slowdown — initiatives such as the BRI have the capacity to stimulate individual and regional economies. Besides, the summit has taken place at a time when the United States, under Donald Trump, has abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade treaty, and, with it, a larger strategy towards Asia Pacific.
 
 For long, there has been talk of Asian highways and railways but these ambitious projects have remained on paper only.
 
 On the other hand, the BRI offers a real breakthrough for countries that either don’t have the capacity to invest in infrastructure or have failed to see such an investment through a strategic prism.
 
 For China — the BRI is a game changer in a civilisational sense and in terms of foreign policy. It is nothing short of revolutionary for a civilisation known for the Great Wall and an inward-looking attitude to secure itself from the outside world. The multiple infrastructural projects and corridors cut across the Great Wall — emotionally and economically. The corridors look forward to integrating regional economies with China and beyond. Already China has become the largest trading partner for many countries in Asia and elsewhere. The BRI would expand the volume and movement of goods (along with people) even further. Soon Chinese cities — from Shanghai to Chengdu — will become an attraction for, among others, our students — just like Australia has been for some time.
 
 In terms of foreign policy, the BRI is the biggest push undertaken by a Chinese leader. In fact, it is the exact opposite of Den Xiaoping’s strategy. For Chinese president Xi Jinping, the BRI is ambitious project not only from a foreign policy perspective but also from the point of view of sustaining China’s economic growth internally. The Xi Jinping government is also creating institutions and regional networks that will support the push induced by the BRI. These include regional institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to multiple sub-regional groupings such as the SCO.
 
 Clearly, China under Xi Jinping is serious about the BRI. And undoubtedly, the BRI is an opportunity for other Asian countries as well.
 
 From an Asian perspective, with the onset of the BRI cutting across national sentiments, it will perhaps be the first time in the recent past when the future of Asian countries will be closely intertwined with one of their own. Contemporary Asia — both at the mainland and maritime sectors — is now looking beyond United Kingdom and United States — who have yet been shaping the Continent’s future, politically and economically. China today has the potential to shape an Asian future and lead it too. In the process, Asia also has the potential to shape global politics.
 
 If BRI is an opportunity, then where do the apprehensions come from? Why certain European countries, US and India are not as enthusiastic as those in Central, South and Southeast Asia? Apart from Russia, how many countries from the West were present at the BRI at the highest levels? While the media in our part of the world have been discussing the BRI in TV shows, editorials and news analysis — their counterpart in the West seem to be measured in their response. Neither The New York Times nor Washington Post has gone overboard in giving space to the BRI. An editorial in the latter even questioned whether China’s plan to become a global power will be successful.
 
 A section has always been wary of Chinese investments and their political impact on the democratic process. These concerns have been related particularly to Chinese investments in Africa and in our region — Sri Lanka and Myanmar. The question that has been asked is who gets maximum benefit and with what political cost is target counties.
 
 Secondly, a section has expressed concerns about transparency. What projects get funded and with what conditions? What economic fallouts these investments have in terms of loans, debts and payments? Pakistan has also witnessed an internal debate on the issues of political impact and transparency over the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
 
 Thirdly, a section does not see these projects purely as economic. It is believed that some projects have a political objective and the corridors aim at Chinese power projection at the regional and global levels. The question raised has been: is the BRI an economic strategy to become a global super power replacing the US?
 
 India has been apprehensive about the political implications of the CPEC over the Jammu and Kashmir region. The Indian official position is linked to the sovereignty question related to Gilgit-Baltistan which is a part of the CPEC. While India is working with China and bilateral economic relations have been witnessing an upward trajectory, New Delhi’s refusal to participate in the BRI is likely to remain a challenge in Sino-Indian relations. Beijing is also aware of the Indian objections as seen by the recent statements by the Chinese diplomat in New Delhi. Besides the GB factor in the CPEC, India should see the BRI as an opportunity and work towards minimising differences.
 
 Despite the apprehensions and issues of transparency, the BRI is an opportunity for Asia. Obviously, China is looking at its own national interests and sees the BRI as an Asian gateway to its global positioning. Other countries should also look at their own national interests and see how best the BRI would help them to move forward — economically and politically.

Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Minister for Planning, Development and Reforms Khusro Bakhtiar received the Chinese leader upon his arrival at the Nur Khan Airbase.
 
 Foreign Minister Qureshi told reporters on the occasion that five Memorandums of understanding were going be signed during the Chinese leader’s visit. He said the vice president would also inaugurate some projects. During the visit, the Chinese vice president will hold meetings with President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Imran Khan and Chief of Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa.
 
 The foreign minister said that an investiture ceremony would also be held in Qishan’s honour during which he will receive an award for his role in promotion of bilateral ties between Pakistan and China. The Chinese leader is also scheduled to visit Lahore where he will be received by Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar. He will visit several historical places in the metropolis.
 
 A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry had said earlier that Qishan’s visit to Pakistan would further deepen high-level exchanges, friendship and mutual trust between the two countries and advance the development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, besides bilateral cooperation across the board.
 
 The Chinese leader’s visit comes at a time when new challenges to the China-Pakistan cooperation for development and prosperity are unfolding.
 
 There has been a spate of terrorist violence in Balochistan, apparently meant to deter the Chinese engineers, experts and labour working on some of the projects related to Gwadar port and the western route of the Corridor. In one case, the terrorist group claiming responsibility for the cowardly attack has even mentioned its opposition to the CPEC.
 
 Then there is a wave of disinformation regarding the Belt and Road Initiative which is being portrayed as a neo-colonialist venture aiming at making China a 21st century imperial state prospering at the cost of its development partners; and reducing their peoples to painful compromises on sovereignty, even virtual slavery. The people-to-people contacts and exchanges are also being targeted with exaggerated accounts of human trafficking, modern slavery and forced prostitution. China is also being accused of not only oppressing its religious and ethnic minorities, including Muslims, but also encouraging disregard of human rights by partner governments.
 
 Meanwhile, there are new developments on the geo-political and geo-strategic scene. To the east, Prime Minister Narendra Modi who campaigned on an irresponsibly anti-Pakistan platform has been re-elected in India. To the West, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf are seeing heightened military activity as United States brings in warships, aircraft and troops ostensibly to fight Iran, a move that threatens to make the oil trade through the Strait of Hormuz very uncertain. *","['slavery', 'visit', 'minister', 'vice', 'chinese', 'development', 'president', 'foreign', 'china', 'welcome', 'terrorist', 'guest']","{'China': 6, 'India': 1, 'Pakistan': 5, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

Agreements involving projects costing $64 billion were signed on the occasion. Pakistan and China have now entered discussions to finalize the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Prime Minister Imran Khan was one of only seven foreign leaders requested to address the Forum. He also met President Xi and Vice President Wang Qishan and discussed bilateral issues. The presence of Russian and Italian leaders accorded the Forum a political importance in addition to its economic value.
 
 Pakistan has much to gain from the international forum, where its eastern neighbor India was conspicuous by its absence. Prime Minister Imran Khan rightly called on Indian leadership to consider joining the Forum for regional prosperity and more collaborative initiatives. The government may also have gained points in terms of domestic politics as it was reported to have persuaded the Chinese government to prioritize its projects. The phased programme has been under deliberation for seven years. Most of the programme components were thus based on projects favoured by the previous governments. The government will do well to discuss its plans on the floor of the parliament so that a consensus can be built in their support. Openness about development projects involving foreign funding makes for a clear roadmap and a secure future.
 
 Once the prime minister is back in the country, he should brief the nation on the gains of the first phase of the CPEC and about plans for the second phase. The previous government drew a lot flak for allegedly disregarding the concern for transparency. This threatened to drive a wedge between the provincial and federal governments and the PTI-led government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was often seen leading the protests.
 
 The information shared so far with the media indicates that the next phase is mainly about industrial cooperation, development of special economic zones, private sector investment and joint ventures. The second phase agreements include a free trade accord, the Main Line-1 railway upgrade and the establishment of Havelian Dry Port, cooperation in marine sciences, implementation of projects on socioeconomic development, China-Pakistan Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement and Rashakai SEZ joint venture.
 
 The FTA will open 90 per cent of the Chinese markets for Pakistani goods. Pakistani exporters are very excited about this. Last year, the Chinese share of Pakistani markets was $11.458 billion while Pakistani exports to China were a mere $1.744 billion. The new FTA is expected to increase Pakistani exports by $500 million. In itself this is not huge but an open access to Chinese markets might benefit Pakistani traders in other ways. *","['projects', 'second', 'minister', 'markets', 'chinese', 'economic', 'pakistani', 'prime', 'forum', 'cpec', 'phase']","{'China': 5, 'India': 2, 'Pakistan': 10}",,,,,

 BEIJING: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang holds a welcome ceremony for Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is paying an official visit to China, ahead of their talks at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, capital of China, July 4, 2019. (Xinhua/Zhang Ling) BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) China and Bangladesh on Thursday agreed to advance their cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative.
 
 The consensus was reached by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and visiting Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is on an official visit to China. Calling Bangladesh an important cooperation partner of China in South Asia, Li hailed the two countries’ traditional friendship. “Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the two sides have always understood and supported each other on issues involving core interests and major concerns,” Li said.
 
 In 2016, the two countries established strategic partnership of cooperation. Li voiced China’s willingness to keep close high-level exchanges with Bangladesh, strengthen strategic mutual trust, boost mutually beneficial cooperation, enhance people-to-people friendship, so as to push for new development of bilateral relations. Both China and Bangladesh are developing countries with large populations and important tasks to develop economy and improve people’s livelihoods, Li said, adding that pragmatic cooperation between the two countries has been fruitful and enjoys great potential and broad prospects.
 
 Li stressed that China stood ready to better synergize the Belt and Road Initiative with Bangladesh’s development strategy, and speed up mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields. He also expressed expectation to discuss feasibility of joint study on the free trade agreement, increase import of Bangladeshi high-quality products meeting the needs of the Chinese market, promote balanced development of trade, and facilitate bilateral investment and personnel exchanges. China will continue to provide assistance within its capacity for Bangladesh’s development, Li added.
 
 He called on the two sides to work together to build the Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar-Economic Corridor (BCIM EC), in a bid to connect the market covering nearly 3 billion people, promote common development, better complement each other’s advantages, and realize mutual benefits. The two countries should intensify communication and coordination in international and regional affairs and play a positive role in regional peace, stability and development, the Chinese premier said. Hasina expressed her congratulations on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, and said Bangladesh-China ties are at a high level.
 
 Both sides are committed to peace, stability, mutual benefits, and settlement of disputes by peaceful means, Hasina said, adding that Bangladesh would celebrate the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties with China next year. She said Bangladesh was advancing the goal of “Sonar Bangla” at present, reiterating that her country was willing to actively participate in the joint construction of the Belt and Road, accelerate the building of the BCIM EC, press ahead regional connectivity, beef up cooperation on trade, investment, service and infrastructure, so as to jointly embrace an even better future.

 The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), or as it is also known the “One Belt, One Road” project, was first announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013. China’s need to make connections with the rest of the world through infrastructure, investment and trade was the driving force behind this transnational economic project. Despite some countries such as the United States speaking out against the BRI, China has mentioned that it welcomes the participation of any nation in this endeavor. It should be noted that if there is no hidden agenda, the BRI could play an important role between countries through economic and cultural exchanges.
 
 The BRI has two main branches which connect China to Europe, with the first being the Silk Road Economic Belt, which includes countries in Central and South Asia. It starts in Xian, which then goes through countries such as Kazakhstan, Iran and Turkey until it reaches Duisburg in Germany. There are other branches such as the link between China-Mongolia-Russia, the link between China and Pakistan, and the link between China and Bangladesh-Myanmar-India.
 
 The second branch is the New Maritime Silk Road which connects China to Europe through ports in Southeast Asia, the Gulf countries, and North Africa. It starts in Guangzhou, and goes through the Malacca Strait, then through ports in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan until Venice.
 
 China’s gains and spending: The BRI projects are estimated to cost between $1 trillion and $8 trillion. Naturally, the lion’s share of the benefits would go to China, and not to the US or the West, since it is the largest contributor in this giant project. Besides, China has plans to spend $1 trillion in the next coming years on top of $300 billion already having been invested. One such example is the over $60 billion spent by China in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.
 
 China has continued investing in projects all over the world despite the many claims and criticisms that follow them wherever they go. These claims and criticisms are a result of the relations between China and countries such as Cambodia, Djibouti, Mongolia and Pakistan. There are some circles that claim these countries will be drowning in Chinese debt. However, countries, particularly poorer or smaller countries, should look out for alternative ways to find equilibrium in its relations with the bigger powers. As an example, it was only recently that Malaysia pushed for a visible discount of over 30 percent in the Chinese led East Coast Rail Link project.
 
 Naturally, any country investing such a huge amount will be looking for political and economic clout. For example, the primary aim of the Marshall Plan was to rebuild the war-torn nations and to prevent the expansion of communism after World War II. From China’s viewpoint, Chinese-led projects have already helped the country establish its own version of regional, if not global, direct or indirect alliances and blocs. However, China has rejected claims that include the debt trap accusations. As such, this year’s second BRI forum was renamed to “Belt and Road Cooperation: Shaping a Brighter Shared Future.”
 
 International achievements: Furthermore, in addition to making various investments around the world, China has pursued a successful policy to draw other countries around its orbit. In this regard, there are around 130 countries and 29 international organizations that have signed cooperation agreements with China to work under the framework of the BRI.
 
 In this year’s BRI forum, in addition to leaders from 37 countries, there were nearly 5,000 representatives from 90 international organizations spread over 150 countries in attendance. Italy, the first G7 country which signed an agreement with China for the BRI, participated in the forum at the prime ministerial level. Moreover, all ASEAN member states were present due to China, the main sponsor of the BRI, having invested billions of dollars throughout Asia. The trade volume between China and the participant countries amounts to over $6 trillion, thus no country would want to be out of China’s economic reach.
 
 Xi Jinping emphasized the importance of multilateralism, globalization and global governance while opposing protectionism. He signaled the start of new reforms and changes on several issues such as intellectual property protection, in addition to better and wider access to the Chinese market. Most importantly, he emphasized the role of the BRI by stating the project would lead to people-centric economic and social development throughout the BRI countries. China has already begun upgrading itself to another level in regard to political and economic means through the BRI.
 
 China-led institutions in play: In order to finance infrastructure projects, Jinping proposed the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in 2013. It has a capital of $100 billion, with China being the largest stakeholder. Currently, it consists of 97 members, including 27 prospective members.
 
 The AIIB programs have crucial targets that include an increase in regional integration and the promotion of economic development. According to the AIIB’s website, total global investment projects are worth nearly $8 billion.
 
 Turkey has a 2.52 percent voting power with $2.5 billion provided capital to the AIIB.The Silk Road Fund is another initiative by China to continue its projects. In 2014, the initial amount for this fund was $40 billion. According to the official website of the Silk Road Forum, the capital for this fund are provided by the State Administration of Foreign exchange (65 percent), Export-Import Bank of China (15 percent), China Investment Corporation (15 percent) and China Development Banks. The fund has investment projects across the globe, and cooperation agreements with countries, such as France and Pakistan; and organizations such as the European Investment Bank.
 
 Implications for Turkey: The BRI may prove to be a potential advantage or disadvantage for Turkey. So, Turkey should follow a mutually beneficial policy. It is well known that Turkey is situated at a unique geographical location, therefore it makes Turkey a bridge between three continents. In addition, Turkey’s democratic system, openness and inclusiveness in terms of political, economic, social and cultural means make Turkey shine among other regional countries for the BRI.
 
 China is growing politically and economically. So, Turkey should prioritize its policies on what it could gain from China.
 
 China can be an alternate pole for the economic and technological transformation of Turkey. In addition, other Asian countries should be within the sphere of Turkey’s trajectory in case of political disturbance between the two. Considering the BRI as a beneficial opportunity while taking preventive measures regarding its sectors sounds logical. There should not be another spillover wave of cheap Chinese products into Turkish sectors as in the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s.
 
 Cooperation with the BRI may ease Turkey’s economic and technological transformation into high-valued product producers. Mutuality is an important instrument in the relationship between Turkey and China under the BRI. Turkey should take advantage of being unique among other regional players as a trade-investment hub for the region under the BRI. The potential trade volume that comes with being included in the BRI is large. So, Turkey might explore markets in the BRI according to its capability, sectors, and ability to cooperate with partners.
 
 Since the BRI is mainly based on economic gains, Turkey should not be in a foreign policy dilemma between being an ally of the West and China because of this project. Lastly, there are always other alternatives that include allying economically and technologically with countries such as Japan and South Korea.
 
 The BRI could be considered a pipe dream for now since there is still a long way to go in order to realize the full scale of this project. However, China has endeavored to make its dream come true by investing billions of dollars worldwide. This is China’s 21st century’s project, the main driver being the need to connect itself with countries from Africa to Europe, and to Asia and America. However, it may be a pipe dream for the rest of the world, especially for borrowers participating in the BRI. The BRI could be considered the perfect project for all humanity if there were no clashing political sides. China has tried to back the BRI project through many initiatives such as “My Story” at China Global Television Network (CGTN). On the other hand, issues such as Cambodians complaining of rising expenses following the Chinese investments in their cities have appeared out in a few newspapers.
 
 Moreover, to complete this project, countries need a strong, healthy, effective, and efficient cooperative mechanism that provides all participants, regardless of small, middle or big power, mutual understanding to discuss remaining issues, risks, and the level of contribution. An issue should not turn into economic and political instrument under the framework of the BRI for shaping a brighter future for all.","['initiative', 'countries', 'projects', 'belt', 'implications', 'investment', 'economic', 'political', 'pros', 'cons', 'turkey', 'china', 'bri', 'road', 'project']","{'Bangladesh': 2, 'China': 38, 'Germany': 1, 'Djibouti': 1, 'France': 1, 'India': 1, 'Italy': 1, 'Japan': 1, 'Kazakhstan': 1, 'Cambodia': 2, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'Myanmar': 1, 'Mongolia': 2, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Pakistan': 5, 'Turkey': 17, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 Xi and 37 world leaders wrapped up a three-day forum in Beijing with pledges to ensure that projects on the new Silk Road are green and financially sustainable following concerns about debt and environmental damage.
 
 “We are committed to supporting open, clean and green development and rejecting protectionism,” Xi told journalists at the end of the forum, without taking questions.
 
 His signature foreign policy aims to reinvent the ancient Silk Road to connect Asia to Europe and Africa through massive investments in maritime, road and rail projects — with hundreds of billions of dollars in financing from Chinese banks.
 
 But critics say the six-year-old project is a plan to boost Beijing’s global influence, riddled with opaque deals favouring Chinese companies and saddling nations with debt and environmental damage.
 
 The US, India and some European nations have looked at the project with suspicion. Washington did not send any representatives to the meeting.
 
 “This year’s forum sends a clear message: more and more friends and partners will join in the Belt and Road co-operation,” Xi said.
 
 A document released after the meeting showed that Equatorial Guinea, Liberia, Luxembourg, Jamaica, Peru, Italy, Barbados, Cyprus and Yemen were the latest countries to join the club.
 
 Xi said enterprises will be the main driver in all Belt and Road projects and market principles will apply, with governments providing a supporting role.
 
 “This will make the projects more sustainable and create a fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign investors,” Xi said.
 
 Xi said that business leaders meeting at a side event signed some $64 billion worth of deals during the forum, without providing details.
 
 At the picturesque Yanqi Lake outside Beijing, leaders from Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America gathered to issue a joint communique.
 
 The gathering included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, whose nation became the first G7 member to join Belt and Road, and Pakistan’s Imran Khan.
 
 Project ‘sustainability –
 
 The massive projects, financed mainly through Chinese bank loans and investments, have raised concerns that poorer countries are being saddled with debt — Sri Lanka turned over a deep-sea port to China for 99 years after it was unable to repay loans.
 
 A communique released at the end of the meeting said leaders encouraged multilateral development banks and other international financial institutions to support projects “in fiscally sustainable ways” and mobilise private capital in line with local needs.
 
 “We emphasise the importance of economic, social, fiscal, financial and environmental sustainability of projects,” it said.
 
 The draft communique says BRI will welcome developed countries and international investors to participate in the projects.
 
 “Faced with this rising resistance for the past year and a half and this debt image … China is trying to reposition (BRI) and send a reassuring message,” said Nadege Rolland, a senior fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research, a US-based think tank.
 
 But “let’s see how it is put into practice”, she said.
 
 China’s finance ministry released guidelines Thursday for assessing financial risk and debt sustainability to apply to projects in BRI countries.
 
 But the document notes that countries already facing payment problems or in the process of restructuring payments “does not automatically mean that debt is unsustainable in a forward-looking sense”.
 
 ‘Civilised and soft’ –
 
 Beijing also published a list Saturday of 283 “deliverables” that bore the Belt and Road brand name, including agreements between museums and art festivals, and even cooperation on space — a clear sign that BRI is a major soft power tool for China as well.
 
 Russian President Vladimir Putin praised China for acting in a “civilised and soft manner” and he took a veiled swipe at the United States.
 
 “Nobody wants sanctions, nobody wants trade wars, except those who start them. These sanctions harm the world economy,” Putin said, adding that China “currently defends liberal values”.
 
 BRI projects have faced pushback in some countries. In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cancelled some planned works and renegotiated a rail project, cutting 30 percent off the price tag.
 
 But Mahathir and other leaders attending the summit had fulsome praise for BRI.","['countries', 'projects', 'joining', 'debt', 'deals', 'belt', 'leaders', 'nations', 'china', 'bri', 'xi', 'join', '64bn', 'road']","{'Barbados': 1, 'China': 6, 'Cyprus': 1, 'Guinea': 1, 'Equatorial Guinea': 1, 'India': 1, 'Italy': 1, 'Jamaica': 1, 'Liberia': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'Luxembourg': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Peru': 1, 'United States': 3, 'Yemen': 1}",,,,,

 Major EU countries are ready to sign a memorandum of understanding on China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a group rather than individual states, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told the Second BRI Forum in Beijing.
 
 “In the big EU states we have agreed that we don’t want to sign any bilateral memorandums, but together make necessary arrangements between the greater European Economic Area and the economic area of Greater China”, Altmaier underscored.
 
 He added that Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom had already shown at the Beijing forum on Friday that the EU was “in its great majority” united in its vision that “we can only implement our positions together”.
 
 Separately, Altmaier applauded President Xi’s pledge to pursue free trade, multilateralism, and sustainability as part of the Belt and Road, saying that “we will take this promise seriously”.
 
 The German economy minister’s remarks come shortly after Xi said in his keynote speech at the BRI forum that the next step for the international project was to push the initiative towards high-quality development, with a focus on green infrastructure and finance.
 
 “We need to ensure the commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects so that they will achieve the intended goals as planned. Everything should be done in a transparent way and we should have zero tolerance for corruption”, Xi pointed out.
 
 EU member states have repeatedly signalled their readiness to take part in the BRI project, with Italy in March becoming the first major Western government to support Beijing’s initiative, a move that was slammed by the US.
 
 The BRI, also known as the One Belt, One Road project, was first announced by the Chinese President in 2013 and remains one of Xi’s most ambitious foreign policy and economic plans.
 
 The goal is to boost cooperation between Eurasian countries and accelerate economic growth in the region. The project also stipulates promoting investment in projects that would link dozens of countries across Africa, Asia, and Europe through the creation of infrastructure networks similar in purpose to the ancient Silk Road trading routes.","['initiative', 'countries', 'forum', 'minister', 'eu', 'belt', 'economic', 'chinas', 'german', 'group', 'bri', 'sign', 'states', 'road', 'project']","{'China': 2, 'Germany': 1, 'Spain': 1, 'France': 1, 'United Kingdom': 1, 'Italy': 2, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 Since its launch in 2013, what China calls “One Belt, One Road” has emerged as the corner-stone of Beijing’s economic statecraft. Under the umbrella of the Belt and Road, Beijing seeks to promote a more connected world brought together by a web of Chinese-funded physical and digital infrastructure. The infrastructure needs in Asia and beyond are significant, but the Belt and Road is more than just an economic initiative; it is a central tool for advancing China’s geo-political ambitions. Through the economic activities bundled under the Belt and Road, Beijing is pursuing a vision of the 21st century defined by great power spheres of influence, state-directed economic interactions, and creeping authoritarianism.1
 
 As Beijing prepares to host the second Belt and Road Forum in late April 2019, countries that once welcomed Chinese investment have become increasingly vocal about the downsides. This report is intended to serve as a resource for governments, corporations, journalists, and civil society groups now re-evaluating the costs and benefits of Belt and Road projects. Building on previous research by the Center for a New American Security and other institutions,2 this report provides a high-level overview of the primary challenges associated with China’s Belt and Road. It explores these challenges in the context of 10 cases that have received little high-profile attention and identifies future concerns generated by the Belt and Road’s growing digital focus. Lastly, the report puts forward a checklist for evaluating future infrastructure projects involving China.
 
 Seven Challenges Created by Chinese Investment
 
 Although not monolithic, Chinese infrastructure projects feature a number of common challenges for recipient states. These challenges include:
 
 Erosion of national sovereignty: Beijing has obtained control over select infrastructure projects through equity arrangements, long-term leases, or multi-decade operating contracts.
 
 Lack of transparency: Many projects feature opaque bidding processes for contracts and financial terms that are not subject to public scrutiny.
 
 Unsustainable financial burdens: Chinese lending to some countries has increased their risk of debt default or repayment difficulties, while certain completed projects have not generated sufficient revenue to justify the cost.
 
 Disengagement from local economic needs: Belt and Road projects often involve the use of Chinese firms and labor for construction, which does little to transfer skills to local workers, and sometimes involve inequitable profit-sharing arrangements.
 
 Geopolitical risks: Some infrastructure projects financed, built, or operated by China can compromise the recipient state’s telecommunications infrastructure or place the country at the center of strategic competition between Beijing and other great powers.
 
 Negative environmental impacts: Belt and Road projects in some instances have proceeded without adequate environmental assessments or have caused severe environmental damage.
 
 Significant potential for corruption: In countries that already have a high level of kleptocracy, Belt and Road projects have involved payoffs to politicians and bureaucrats.
 
 These challenges associated with China’s Belt and Road are not limited to a particular region or type of infrastructure project. A survey of 10 lesser-known Chinese projects across the globe shows that all feature three or more of these challenges.

354,The Frontier Post,https://thefrontierpost.com/promising-future-awaits-afghanistan-with-chinas-belt-and-road/,0.7,,Pakistan,E,2019-04-06 17:18:19+00:00,Promising future awaits Afghanistan with China’s Belt and Road,"KABUL (Afghanistan Time): Since years, China has been striving to revitalize the ancient Silk Road and expand it into a global trade network to connect its southernmost parts to Central Asia and South and Southeast Asia, Eurasia, and Europe. But Afghanistan has been peripheral to China’s intercontinental project because drastic security conditions have made it impossible to pursue a serious economic agenda there.
 
 The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which is a vast network of infrastructure projects spans more than 60 countries. But the BRI largely excludes Afghanistan, moving through Central Asia and Pakistan instead.
 
 Although there have been painstaking efforts in place by the Afghan government to make the BRI happen in the war-wracked country, the speed of the project has remained snail-paced considering the security and political turmoil. Alas, as Afghanistan’s allies are reaching a negotiated settlement with the radical Taliban to put an end to an 18-year insurgency and with these negotiations edging toward a concrete conclusion, peace may now be on the horizon.
 
 For Beijing, peace would not only reduce the terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan, but it could also boost Chinese economic activity. It will give rise to an era when there will be no hindrance to implementation of the Belt and Road and a vast chunk of investment is funneled into Afghanistan for building transit routes and other infrastructure projects. With the war in Afghanistan winding down, China seems willing to make Afghanistan a bigger part of its regional ambitions.
 
 The ground realities have also manifested China’s will to establish its grip by simply engaging in trade and economic activities. In 2016, China and Afghanistan entered a new phase of economic cooperation; Beijing and Kabul signed a MoU on the BRI then and the first Chinese cargo train carrying goods valued at $20 million arrived in the northern Afghan port city of Hairatan after about two weeks of journey via Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
 
 Since then, China has been planning to send two trains per month to carry textiles, electronic products and construction materials to Afghanistan. Moreover, Kabul-Urumqi direct flight was resumed – after being closed at the end of 2012 – and there is a flight every once in a week from Kabul to Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and vice versa cutting travel time between the two cities from 13 hours to 3 hours.
 
 China is also Afghanistan’s largest business investor, it has pledged increasing amounts of aid to the country, and Chinese companies have been involved in construction projects. China will be able to potentially use the opportunity to cut transit costs and time and obtain easy access to South Asia and Europe. A trade and transit feat under an ambitious BRI megaproject in the continent is highly unlikely if Afghanistan is not a significant part of it and if the strategically significant land-locked country is bypassed.

 KARACHI: Standard Chartered announced the launch of the Standard Chartered Belt & Road Relay, the first-ever global running event spanning the Belt and Road initiative, with the aim of highlighting the Bank’s continued commitment to Belt and Road, and the positive impact of the initiative to communities and businesses globally.
 
 The Relay will be led by eight staff athletes from Standard Chartered, selected from the Bank’s diverse footprint in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Europe and the Americas. These athletes will participate in running events across 44 Belt and Road markets within a 90-day period.
 
 Commenting on the launch, Bill Winters, Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered, said, “The Belt and Road Initiative is the most ambitious and far-reaching project of its kind in the world today. We are present in two-thirds of Belt and Road markets, and our rich heritage, deep local knowledge and unparalleled connectivity mean that we’re ideally placed to help our partners, clients and communities to make the most out of the initiative. By traversing these markets on foot and engaging local clients, governments, media and communities, our Standard Chartered Belt & Road Relay athletes will showcase our commitment to be the One Bank for the Belt and Road.”
 
 The Standard Chartered Belt & Road Relay kicked off in Hong Kong on 17 February, in conjunction with the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon, which is one of the biggest sports events in the city with over 74,000 runners, and will end in China on 11 May after the Belt and Road Forum.
 
 Shazad Dada, Chief Executive Officer, Standard Chartered Pakistan commented, “We are very proud to host the Belt & Road Relay in Pakistan. The Bank has been in Pakistan and China for more than 150 years. Our longstanding and deep-rooted presence in both countries along with 70 per cent of footprint overlap with B&R countries equips us with in-depth knowledge of prevailing political, economic and cultural environments making us an indispensable partner in this extra ordinary progress. It is therefore incumbent upon us to assist our valued clients to capitalize on these enormous trade opportunities created through better connectivity between them and the rest of the world.
 
 This Belt & Road Relay emphasises our promise to be ‘Here for good’, while demonstrating our capabilities in providing comprehensive set of products, services and solutions to our existing as well as prospective clients who are looking to embark upon their growth journeys along the Silk Road.”
 
 China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a flagship project of China’s ‘One belt, One Road’ (OBOR) initiative which will connect Western China to Gwadar Port in Arabian Sea – forming a network of road, rail links to boost trade. Involves variety of energy & infrastructure projects worth $62billion. Standard Chartered has already secured a few major mandates for onshore & offshore banking relationships for these projects in Pakistan essentially providing all services including debt and equity proceeds, FX flows, working capital requirements.
 
 The Belt and Road initiative is core to Standard Chartered. In 2017, the Bank committed additional financing for Belt and Road projects of at least USD 20 billion by 2020, and was involved in more than 50 Belt and Road deals worth more than USD 10billion across a range of products and services.","['initiative', 'projects', 'clients', 'services', 'belt', 'launches', 'running', 'standard', 'relay', 'event', 'firstever', 'chartered', 'pakistan', 'global', 'road']","{'China': 5, 'Hong Kong': 2, 'Pakistan': 5, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 The Italian government is ready to join the New Silk Roads project, but the president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China warns that foreign firms’ success in the Chinese market is not decided by memorandum of understandings. The problem of transparency
 
 Italy is set to become the first G7 country and founding member of the EU to formally endorse China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a move that has puzzled the United States and the European Union’s institutions.
 
 Beijing and Rome are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the latter’s participation in the BRI during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Italy from March 21-23. Similar agreements on the China’s megaproject, which is designed to improve trade integration and connectivity across Eurasia and beyond, have already been inked by 13 EU member states.
 
 Italian government leaders who have worked on the MoU say it will give their country’s businesses greater access to the vast Chinese market.
 
 Mats Harborn, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, is not so sure that there is such a clear link between the two things.
 
 “The signing of this MoU is more a statement that Italy wants to show its support for the Belt and Road scheme” he told AsiaNews. “It should be remembered just how competitive the Chinese market is, and business success in China is not decided by such agreements.”
 
 For Harborn, it is possible that China might offer Italy special access to certain licences or could accelerate approvals, but to do so would be highly problematic at a time when its leadership is doubling down on pledges to provide equal treatment to foreign companies.
 
 “Since the BRI is potentially very important for a large part of the global economy, we hope that Italy’s signing signifies a step towards increasing involvement from the EU as a whole,” he pointed out.
 
 In his view, if the MoU is rightly formulated, with China committing to an open and inclusive BRI based on international norms and standards, “the chances of the project becoming sustainable would be vastly increased.”
 
 On March 15, on the final day of its annual plenary session, the National’s People Congress (China’s top legislature) adopted a new foreign-investment law that should ensure a level playing field between domestic and foreign industries.
 
 This is a sensitive issue for the EU, which has been negotiating a comprehensive investment agreement with the Asian giant since 2013.
 
 “If Italy’s signing of this MoU led to greater transparency, as well as more and equal opportunities for European companies to participate in BRI projects, then it would be a positive step towards reciprocity in procurement practices, particularly as far as the public sector is concerned,” Harborn said. “After all, Chinese companies enjoy access to the EU’s open procurement market and frequently win bids, while European companies have [so far] lacked similar access, both in China and abroad in BRI projects.”
 
 Transparency is especially important when it comes to China’s trade and investments practices, which are often seen as opaque and part of a “debt-trap” diplomacy, with developing countries – but also struggling EU countries such as Greece and Portugal – becoming heavily dependent on Chinese loans.
 
 In this respect, Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Security and Strategic Studies in Washington, noted that “if the entire process is transparent, and the Chinese do not force Italy to use Chinese labor and materials, there is nothing wrong with Italian participation in the BRI.”

 BEIJING: China sees growing ties with Belt and Road countries in trade and economy over the past five years, as by June 2018, merchandise trade between China and countries along the route has exceeded $5 trillion.
 
 In the past five years, China’s total investment in economic and trade cooperation zones in these countries amounted to $28.9 billion, creating $2.01 billion of tax revenues and providing 244,000 local jobs, said Ning Jizhe, chief of the National Bureau of Statistics.
 
 China-proposed core concepts such as co-construction of the Belt and Road and the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration have been incorporated into the outcome documents of the UN and other important international mechanisms, the official noted.
 
 China has signed 118 cooperation agreements with 103 countries and international organizations on developing the Belt and Road, added Ning, also deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office.
 
 The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in Beijing last year yielded 279 concrete actionable results, with 265, or 95 percent of them having been completed or normalized as regular practices and the rest 14 being pushed ahead, he added.
 
 A large number of Belt and Road cooperation projects have achieved substantial progress, such as the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.
 
 China has become the largest trading partner of 25 countries along the Belt and Road, Vice Minister of Commerce Qian Keming noted, adding that its total trade with the en-route countries has surpassed $5 trillion over the past five years, with an annual average growth of 1.1 percent against the falling world trade.
 
 In the past five years, China has directly invested more than $70 billion in Belt and Road countries, an average annual growth of 7.2 percent.
 
 The value of newly-signed contracted engineering projects in the countries exceeded $500 billion, according to Qian. In addition, China has been easing market access for foreign investment and creating better business environment to attract investment from Belt and Road countries, he noted.
 
 Steady progress has been made by China and en-route countries in co-building economic and trade zones.","['countries', 'reaches', 'belt', 'trade', 'cooperation', 'chinas', 'past', 'billion', 'china', 'international', '5t', 'road', 'investment']","{'China': 10, 'Mali': 1, 'Pakistan': 1}",,,,,

 The Belt and Road is Chinese President Xi Jinping’s landmark scheme to build infrastructure to connect China to the rest of Asia and beyond, a giant reworking of its old Silk Road.
 
 India has not signed up to the initiative as parts of one key project, the $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, runs through Kashmir.
 
 Whether or not China will be able to bring India round to Belt and Road will likely be a key measure of the success of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s trip to China to meet Xi for an informal meeting on Friday and Saturday.
 
 But India’s foreign minister did not express support for Belt and Road in the communique released after foreign ministers of the China and Russia-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation met in Beijing.
 
 India, along with Pakistan, joined the group last year.
 
 All the other foreign ministers – from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan – “reaffirmed support for China’s Belt and Road proposal”, the statement read.
 
 It gave no further explanation.
 
 The communique otherwise was a broad expression of unity by the ministers on issues ranging from their support for the Iran nuclear deal to the need to combat the spread of extremism.
 
 Modi is coming to China as efforts at rapprochement gather pace following a difficult year in ties between the two neighbours.
 
 The Asian giants were locked in a 73-day military stand-off in a remote, high-altitude stretch of their Himalayan border last year. At one point, soldiers from the two sides threw stones and punches.
 
 The confrontation between the nuclear-armed powers underscored Indian alarm at China’s expanding security and economic links in South Asia.
 
 In comments carried on the foreign ministry’s website, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou said holding the meeting in an informal way meant the two leaders could have a deep exchange of views in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere to promote cooperation.
 
 “This not only will benefit the two countries and two peoples, but will also have an important effect on peaceful development in the region and around the world,” the ministry paraphrased Kong as telling Indian media in Beijing.
 
 Modi will visit China in June for a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
 
 China will also have to tread carefully to avoid giving its close ally Pakistan cause for alarm. China on Monday reassured Pakistan that relations between the two countries were as firm as ever and would “never rust”.","['modixi', 'indias', 'indian', 'minister', 'belt', 'fails', 'meeting', 'foreign', 'pakistan', 'china', 'summit', 'ministers', 'ahead', 'support', 'road']","{'China': 13, 'India': 9, 'Kazakhstan': 1, 'Kyrgyzstan': 1, 'Pakistan': 5, 'Tajikistan': 1, 'Uzbekistan': 1}",,,,,

The rejection of the three projects, worth nearly $20 billion, comes as a serious jolt to China’s ambitious trade-linking project, the Belt and Road Initiative.
 
 Pakistan cited tough financing terms imposed by China as its reason for canceling the $14 billion Diamer-Bhasha Dam project.
 
 Nepal’s deputy Prime Minister recently announced a decision to scrap a $2.5 billion contract for a hydroelectricity project, accusing the Chinese company of financial irregularities. And Myanmar, which halted a $3.6 billion Chinese-backed dam three years ago, confirmed last month that it no longer is interested in big hydro-electric power projects.
 
 The decisions by China’s neighbors could mean a serious loss of image for BRI, which involves plans to build infrastructure across the globe, including in developed countries like the United States and those in Europe.
 
 While there are also diverse local political and economic reasons behind the three decisions, there is a growing realization among poorer countries that Chinese proposals to build massive infrastructure projects come at an extremely high price, analysts said.
 
 Asked about these decisions by Pakistan and Nepal, the Chinese foreign ministry said it was not aware of it. “I am not aware of this information,” Geng Shuang, foreign ministry spokesman, said at a media briefing. “China and Nepal have sound relations and bilateral cooperation covers a wide range of areas.”
 
 According to the local media accounts, Muzammil Hussain, chairman of Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) in Pakistan told the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of parliament that the Chinese company involved in the project there had imposed very difficult financing conditions, which included pledging the new dam, as well as an existing dam, as loan security.
 
 “Chinese conditions for financing the Diamer-Bhasha Dam were not doable and against our interests,” Hussain said.
 
 Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator at the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers & People, a New Delhi based NGO, said, “For Pakistan, the biggest ally has been China.They (Pakistanis) would not take out this project without consulting them (the Chinese).”
 
 Indeed, China and Pakistan frequently describe their relationship as “all-weather” and “iron brothers.” “As far as Pakistan is concerned, they really want financing for this project,” Zorawar Daulet Singh, an analyst at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi said.
 
 Singh said he would not take the Pakistani official’s statement at face value. Islamabad had approached the World Bank and Asian Development Bank for funding but was turned down, he pointed out.","['projects', 'chinese', 'belt', 'financing', 'nepal', 'decisions', 'dam', 'pakistan', 'jolting', 'billion', 'china', 'myanmar', 'plan', 'project', 'road', 'cancel']","{'China': 6, 'Myanmar': 2, 'Nepal': 4, 'Pakistan': 9, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 ISLAMABAD: The Chinese embassy on Wednesday rejected the statements made by United States (US) Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells regarding the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
 
 Wells had on Tuesday said that Pakistan needed to re-evaluate the agreements it had made with China and consider increasing transparency around CPEC projects. In the statement released in response to Wells, China said the propaganda against CPEC was a “pack of lies”.
 
 A press release issued by the Chinese embassy in Pakistan said that the US was ignoring the facts and was obsessed with the story it had made for itself regarding the economic corridor. “We must not let the truth be distorted and the lies run wild,” the press released read.
 
 “Although you can never wake up a person who is pretending to be asleep, we have to make our position clear and reject the negative propaganda by the US,” the statement added. “We would be more than glad to see the US develop its relationship with Pakistan,” it noted.
 
 While addressing a policy think tank during a visit to Islamabad, the US diplomat had claimed that the debt burden of Pakistan was growing due to Chinese financing. She also touched on the cost escalation in CPEC projects, and questioned the integrity of the companies running them.
 
 “We strongly oppose US interference in China-Pakistan relations and the CPEC. The US holds a stick of sanctions all over the world, blacklists this and that country, not for the global economy, but just to serve its own political purpose,” the Chinese embassy said.
 
 “We also want to advise the US that when you accuse China, you should first look back at what have you done to Pakistan, and think about how much contribution have you made for Pakistan. Did Ms Wells bring any aid, investment or trade for Pakistan during her visit?” it asked.
 
 “If the US truly cares about the development and prosperity of Pakistan and this region, it should bring cash and funds, promote win-win cooperation on the basis of mutual respect rather than act as a world policeman, spreading rumours,” the embassy added.
 
 ‘CPEC created 75,00 jobs, contributed to GDP’
 
 According to the Chinese embassy, Beijing enjoyed a rock-solid relationship with Islamabad and the “unbreakable” ties would continue to steadily advance the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and CPEC to promote regional peace and development.
 
 With respect to progress on CPEC projects, the embassy said that major progress was achieved in the past five years, with 32 projects achieving early harvests. “This has significantly improved local transportation infrastructure and power supply,” the embassy noted.
 
 “It has also created over 75,000 jobs directly and contributed one to two percent of the GDP growth in Pakistan. It shows that CPEC is playing an important role in boosting Pakistan’s socio-economic development and improving people’s livelihood,” the statement further added.
 
 The Chinese embassy also maintained that CPEC was a project between China and Pakistan, and the Pakistani people were benefiting from it. “Under the CPEC, during its planning or implementation, every project is equally discussed, carefully studied and jointly implemented by both China and Pakistan,” it said.
 
 ‘IMF among largest creditors of Pakistan’
 
 Responding to the allegations made by Wells that CPEC projects were not transparent, the embassy noted that the Chinese government always requested Chinese companies, who enjoy international reputations, to operate according to local laws and regulations.
 
 “The entire process is open and transparent and is in line with international norms. We keep in touch with the accountability agencies of Pakistan and it is agreed that the CPEC is clean,” the statement released by the embassy read.
 
 “All projects strictly follow the market-oriented and internationally accepted business model, adopt state of the art technology and strict environmental protection standards,” it further clarified.
 
 The embassy also addressed the allegation that CPEC was a debt-trap, noting that the total foreign debt of Pakistan was $110 billion. “International financial institutions, including the Paris Club and International Monetary Fund, are the largest creditors of Pakistan.”
 
 ‘Will not make unreasonable demands on Pakistan’
 
 The statement further claimed that the loan for CPEC projects stood at around $5.8 billion, accounting for 5.3% of Pakistan’s total foreign debt, with a repayment period of 20-25 years and an interest rate of approximately 2%.
 
 “Its repayments will start in 2021, with annual repayments of about 300 million US dollars. It will never be a burden to Pakistan. Moreover, China has never forced other countries to pay debts, and will not make unreasonable demands on Pakistan,” the embassy said.
 
 “The US keeps fabricating the so-called debt story, their mathematics is bad, and their intention is worse,” the embassy added. Regarding the ML-1 project of the CPEC, the Chinese said that the amounts of the project would be adjusted according to needs of Pakistan.
 
 “After finalising the design of the project, we would initiate bidding in accordance with international practice. This is a completely normal business practice,” the embassy said.","['rejects', 'projects', 'cpec', 'propaganda', 'chinese', 'wells', 'pakistan', 'china', 'alice', 'embassy', 'statement', 'envoy', 'international', 'project']","{'China': 8, 'Pakistan': 24, 'United States': 12}",,,,,

 “Although you can never wake up a person who is pretending to be asleep, we have to make our position clear and reject the negative propaganda by the US,” the embassy’s spokesperson said in response to a question, according to a press release.
 
 The rebuke comes a day after Wells criticised the flagship project of China’s One Belt One Road Initiative and alleged that there was no transparency in CPEC projects. Wells had also claimed that Pakistan’s debt burden was growing due to the Chinese financing.
 
 Responding to her comments on Wednesday, the Chinese embassy spokesperson said, “The comments hold nothing new, but the same cliche in her speech in November, 2019, which has been repeatedly rejected by China and Pakistan.” The statement added that “we must not let the truth be distorted and the lies run wild.”
 
 With regard to Wells’ allegations about blacklisted firms getting contracts in CPEC, the embassy spokesperson said, “The Chinese government always requests the Chinese companies to operate according to local laws and regulations.
 
 “The entire process is open and transparent and is in line with international norm. We keep in touch with the relative accountability agencies of Pakistan and it is agreed that the CPEC is clean.”
 
 To another point raised by Wells regarding CPEC’s contribution to raising Pakistan’s foreign debt, the spokesperson clarified that “according to statistics from the State Bank of Pakistan, the total foreign debt of Pakistan is US $110 billion.
 
 “In fact, international financial institutions including the Paris Club and IMF are the largest creditors of Pakistan. Loan for the CPEC is about $5.8 billion, accounting for 5.3 per cent of Pakistan’s total foreign debt.

 ISTANBUL: The first freight train, which will go to Czechia from China uninterruptedly via Turkey on Wednesday, makes the dream of the Silk Railroad come true.
 
 The real Silk Road was a trade route, which was active between the second-century B.C. and the 18th century, from China to Europe through Anatolia and the Mediterranean.
 
 Within the scope of One Belt One Road Initiative, which aims to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe via road and sea lanes, a freight train will go to Czechia’s capital Prague from Xian — the capital city of Shaanxi Province in central China — through Istanbul’s Marmaray sub-sea tunnel uninterruptedly for the first time.
 
 The train, which will go to Prague on a railway of 11,500 kilometers (7,145 miles), will carry electronic goods with 42 containers, said Fatih Erdogan, the head of logistic company Pasifik Eurasia – which undertook the railway’s Turkey section.
 
 “As a result of significant cooperation with Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkic republics, we will conduct the first rail transportation through China-Europe corridor,” he stressed in a press conference in Istanbul.
 
 China and Europe’s trade volume is around $21 trillion while only 3% of the transportation of this trade is made through railway, he noted.
 
 He added that the first transfer on Wednesday is so important because it will be the beginning of trade through this corridor. Turkey has geopolitical importance and several opportunities in railway transportation, he highlighted.
 
 The railway will reduce the transportation time between China and Turkey from one month to 12 days, while the whole road from Xian to Prague will take 18 days. The train will be welcomed in Ankara on Wednesday.

 The two-day international conference involving inaugural session, envoy sessions, and research papers presentation sessions was sponsored by Chinese embassy in Islamabad, CPEC Centre of Excellence in Islamabad and Centre for Global and Strategic Studies, Islamabad.
 
 The conference was attended among others by the ambassadors of Russia, Iran, Central Asian states to Pakistan, foreign scholars, Vice-Chancellor (VC) UoP Prof. Dr. Muhammad Asif Khan, President Centre of Global Strategic Studies Gen. (rtd) Syed Khalid Jafferi, Director Area Study Centre Prof. Dr. Shabbir Ahmad Khan, Director General China Ministry of Foreign Affairs Pakistan Mudassir Tipu and senior faculty members.
 
 The ambassador said that the Chinese embassy was mulling over to develop cold storage, customs and hospital facilities at the Torkham border.
 
 He said that China wanted connectivity of the region through mutually agreed projects and non-confrontational strategies.
 
 Mr. Yao Jing pointed out that China was intending to complete the Peshawar-Karachi motorway section sooner while Peshawar-Kabul motorway section is the next shot.
 
 He added that China attaches great importance to its ongoing CPEC projects in the province saying Rashakai Economic Zone would generate jobs for the masses of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and would further economic prosperity of the country.
 
 The emissaries of Russia, Iran, Central Asian states to Pakistan vowed to collaborate intellectually for garnering impact of Chinese global projects throughout the region.
 
 Speaking during the welcome address, Director Area Study Centre, Prof. Dr. Shabbir Ahmad Khan called upon the key stakeholders to participate fully in this millennium project of ‘open regional integration’ of regional countries without any restrictions and imposed set of goals.
 
 He pledged that the centre will serve as a pivotal point to garner scholastic and intellectual input for projects of 21st century.
 
 Director General China Ministry of Foreign Affairs Pakistan Mudassir Tipu emphases that Peshawar being sister city of Urumqi has an important role to play in BRI and connectivity of Peshawar between western China and Central Asian States.
 
 He quoted Chinese president Xi Jinping from BOAO forum as saying that BRI would “promote inter-civilization exchanges to build bridges of friendship for our people, drive human development and safeguard peace of the world”.
 
 President Centre of Global Strategic Studies Gen. (rtd) Syed Khalid Jafferi stressed that regional integration would take a longer time if the afghan security situation does not develop stable and secure for connectivity routes.
 
 Director CPEC centre of excellence, Islamabad Liaqat Ali Shah emphasized that industrial and trade development was in the offing after major energy and infrastructure projects are under completion in the CPEC project.
 
 He promoted the idea that CPEC and BRI would boost economies of the region as regional business would have loin share in the trade that is currently abysmally at 3 % in the region, and could follow EU intra-regional trade of 61% .
 
 VC UoP Prof. Dr. Muhammad Asif Khan called upon the participants that time has arrived to materialize connectivity with China and Central Asia as these regions are only 40kms away aerially from Himalayas.

 US President Donald Trump will visit Japan as a state guest from May 25 to 28. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe just visited the US in late April and Trump is scheduled to attend the G20 summit held in Osaka, a Japanese city, in June. It’s rare for leaders of Japan and the US to meet for three consecutive months. Why are they meeting so frequently?
 
 After Trump won the presidential election, Abe was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump. Since May 1, Japan has entered into the Reiwa era. Trump will be the first state leader to visit Japan after Emperor Naruhito’s accession to the throne, which shows the importance of Tokyo-Washington alliance.
 
 Trump and Abe do have several issues to discuss. The Korean Peninsula issue is one of them. Japan is concerned with denuclearization process and the issue of kidnapped Japanese nationals. Since tensions on the Korean Peninsula eased in 2018, Japan is the only country of the Six-Party Talks participants which has not held a summit with North Korea. Japan appears to have been relatively marginalized on the Korean issue and its voice and influence has been reduced. Japan needs US support to realize its goals and to expand its influence on the Korean Peninsula. Before the summits between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Trump, Abe raised the abduction issue with Trump. Abe may be hoping to get US approval to explore ways to meet Kim.
 
 Trade talks between the two nations would be another topic of discussion. Japan does not want to be the loser in Japan-US trade talks. Japan may make some concessions, but not many on agriculture, as an upper house election will be held in July, and Abe wants to see his ruling coalition to perform well.
 
 The trade war between Beijing and Washington is heating up, and Japan has $68 billion trade surplus with the US. If the US cannot effectively reduce its trade deficit with China, it may put pressure on Japan, and ask Tokyo to make concessions. Japan may expand its investment in the US to relieve the pressure from Washington in the trade talks and get favorable results. For example, when Abe visited Washington in April, he said Japan would invest $40 billion in the US automobile industry.
 
 In the latest meeting in late May, the US may make a road map for Japan to accelerate the pace for a trade deal. Beijing-Tokyo ties may be another subject. Japan would like to further cooperate with China. However, it needs to take into consideration the US, and would be concerned if closer cooperation with China would impair Japan-US relations.
 
 Since the end of World War II, despite its economic prowess, Tokyo has been unable to get rid of the restrictions and influence of Washington when it comes to diplomacy and politics. Beijing-Washington relations have a significant influence on Tokyo. Japan should try to avoid taking sides. This country needs to balance between the two giants.
 
 Tokyo is dependent on Washington for security, but does not want to provoke China on security matters.
 
 On economy and trade, Japan doesn’t want its cooperation with China under the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative to cause concerns in the US. For example, the Japanese delegations to the first and second Belt and Road Forum were led by the secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Toshihiro Nikai, instead of a cabinet minister. How to successfully maintain a balance between the Beijing and Washington is a test to Tokyo’s strategy and political wisdom.","['washington', 'korean', 'talks', 'japanese', 'japan', 'balancing', 'trade', 'tokyos', 'issue', 'abe', 'china', 'act', 'trump']","{'China': 6, 'Japan': 24, 'United States': 14}",,,,,

 With ever increasing interest rates and a snowballing debt, at what cost is debt in exchange for Chinese development too high?
 
 New skyscrapers stand out against the modern skyline of Colombo, Sri Lanka’s commercial and financial capital, disrupting the soft profile of what once was its tropical coastline and colonial architecture. From Galle Face, the promenade built during Dutch rule on the island stretching along the boundless Indian Ocean, one can get a glimpse of the coastline and the new projects taking shape.
 
 Across the street, behind the grassy park, the cranes know no rest; floodlights allow the construction drive to continue at night, making the area look like a vast stage set under production, where the bustle of machines mixes with the tranquil ocean. Proceeding towards the huge harbour north of Galle Face, the commercial district, Fort, and its colonial buildings are a vivid reminder of the Dutch times. Due to its position in the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has historically been an important commercial hub along maritime routes.
 
 The Portuguese and the Dutch ruled it before the British came to the island until Sri Lanka finally gained independence in 1948. Right next to the fort, backed against the commercial harbour, a new metropolis is feverishly being erected where just the sea used to lie. The construction of the new residential area on the 2.6 square kilometres of land reclaimed from the sea will be starting soon: the master plan includes luxurious apartments, 5-star hotels, a financial district, a golf club, a marina and a Formula One circuit overlooking the Indian Ocean—all framed by tropical beaches and lush green parks.
 
 The city is considered a significant stop on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, ‘yi dai yi lu’, a gargantuan plan to connect 71 strategic points in Asia, Africa and Europe through a belt of land corridors and a road of sea routes: a commercial network aimed at sustaining Chinese economic expansion. Built on an artificial island reclaimed from the ocean by filling 65 million cubic meters of sand against the coast, Colombo Port City will be a free zone ruled by a business-friendly tax regime and, most likely, will have its own legal system.
 
 “Port City will pose major administrative and benefit-sharing issues: it is proposed to run under new regulations, like a financial hub, whose details are not yet publicly available,” asserts Hemantha Withanage, Executive Director of the Colombo-based Centre for Environmental Justice. Withanage claims that the successive Rajapaksa and Maithree-Ranil governments have not been held accountable to the public for the project.
 
 In 2014, Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe of the United National Party shelved the project because it would compromise the coastal strip north and south of Colombo. In 2015, work had stopped due to concerns related to its impact on the coast and related activities, like fishing and tourism, though they resumed the following year, likely due to Chinese pressure. “The new Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) simply green-washed the project without adding substantial changes,” explains Withanage, head of the environmental organisation that in 2015 filed a lawsuit against the Port City.
 
 “The only major change in the project was the shift from 235 hectares of land of the first proposal to the current 269, but the total impact could actually be much more.” The state-owned China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), through its subsidiary the China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), is the firm behind the $1.4 billion project, one of the largest foreign investments in Sri Lanka, to date.
 
 The CCCC, a Chinese real estate investor and developer blacklisted by the World Bank on allegations of corruption, financed a variety of infrastructure on the island: the Southern Highway, the Outer Circular Highway, Matala International Airport and Hambantota Port. The latter, a $1.5-billion project named after the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, was partly funded by a Chinese loan. In 2017, the country, unable to pay off the debt, had no choice but to lease the port to a Chinese firm in a 99-year debt-for-equity swap.
 
 Previous governments, under the controversial leader Mahinda Rajapaksa of the Sri Lankan Freedom Party, borrowed 8 billion dollars from China, most of which was spent on bloated infrastructure projects near his hometown, Hambantota. When China started investing, the country was recovering from two and half decades of a brutal civil war between the Sinhalese government and the Tamil Tigers, that killed over 100,000 people.
 
 The country’s economy stalled until the Sinhalese army victory put an end to the conflict and opened the doors to foreign players, who have been reluctant to invest in a country where human rights violations have been perpetrated with impunity from both sides. In those years, China was one of the few international creditors to invest in the country’s reconstruction. Many of those who oppose the project claim that those in power have not been held accountable for the many murky aspects of the new Port City.
 
 It’s been argued that, despite the project’s obvious economic benefits, environmental issues have not been adequately addressed. Among the many adverse effects of the project, the dredged seabed will cause changes in the marine currents and, hence, an exponential increase in coastal erosion with related damages to coastal activities like tourism and fisheries. The new breakwater, built to protect the island, will add to the erosion, damaging the coral reef, while the coastal economy will be put at risk, together with the livelihood of some 15,000 fishermen.
 
 “Under the Right to Information Act, we requested the ministry involved in the Port City project to disclose the details of the agreement between our country and China – after two refusals, we turned to the RTI Commission,” explains Withanage to TRT World, “What should we think if the government is not ready to disclose the terms and consequences of the project? We are very afraid of what will be decided for its future structure.”
 
 Rumours are that the city will be a financial hub with legislation of its own, distinct from Sri Lanka’s laws. Unlike Hambantota port, the Port City is a direct Chinese investment, not a loan, which would give China even more of an upper hand in decision making. Some analysts fear the multi-billion dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) could be the Trojan horse of China’s economic global penetration through a system of “debt-traps”.
 
 A report published last year by the Center for Global Development (CDG) of the Harvard Kennedy School questions the role of what the authors define as “debt diplomacy” – the practice of lending millions of dollars to countries that cannot afford to pay back, using the debt as a leverage on assets and sovereignty – and identifies eight potential target-countries of debt insolvency. “For most BRI countries, borrowing from China does not pose near-term debt risks. In the same way, I do not think the Chinese government is in a position to create debt traps in most countries.
 
 However, a small number of countries, including Sri Lanka, are vulnerable to debt distress and continue to borrow from China in ways that exacerbate these vulnerabilities,” explains Scott Morris, Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development, who is one of the authors of the report, to TRT World. “Problems also arise when borrowing is not supported by economically viable projects – he argues – cases like Hambantota port suggest that strong due diligence is often missing when evaluating the costs and benefits of major infrastructure investments.”
 
 Sri Lanka’s situation is quoted as a cautionary tale, but the voices are dissenting on the dangers it implies. “In terms of debt, China accounts for only 9 percent of the country’s total outstanding debt. Sri Lanka has relied on borrowing on commercial terms through ISBs, FTFFs and foreign holding of treasury bonds and bills,” argues Kithmina Hewage, an economist with the Institute of Policy Studies in Colombo.
 
 “Therefore, while Chinese loans have contributed to Sri Lanka’s debt, it is not the primary cause but only a secondary factor,” he claims. Today, the country is caught up in a classic vicious cycle of ever-increasing loans to pay old debts and finance ongoing deficits. This high-interest borrowing now exceeds a third of Sri Lanka’s total debt, which faces a 6-billion-dollar foreign debt repayment. With Chinese companies investing in many host countries’ infrastructures through bilateral agreements, the so-called “Silk Road of the 21st Century” represents a significant game-changer in the geopolitical balance of the area. The geopolitical theory behind it, the “String of Pearls”, sees the network of Chinese commercial and strategic facilities and relations along its marine routes as a security threat. China denies any military ambitions in the area.
 
 On the other side of the Palk Strait that divides India from the tear-shaped island of Sri Lanka, work on the new Chinese-funded city proceeds at breakneck speed, despite several unanswered questions. While many people in Sri Lanka view the foreign investments in a positive light, some have started questioning the Chinese role in the country. The fear is that Port City, like the Hambantota port, could soon translate into another loss of sovereignty for the small island.","['city', 'port', 'debt', 'commercial', 'chinese', 'island', 'lankas', 'drowning', 'debtdiplomacy', 'economy', 'china', 'lanka', 'sri', 'project', 'environment']","{'China': 13, 'India': 4, 'Sri Lanka': 13}",,,,,

 Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative, as it is formally called, envisions rebuilding the old Silk Road to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond with massive infrastructure spending.
 
 But it has proved controversial in many Western capitals, particularly Washington, which views it as merely a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and saddle countries with unsustainable debt through nontransparent projects.
 
 The United States has been particularly critical of Italy’s decision to sign up to the plan this month, during Xi’s visit to Rome, the first for a G7 nation.
 
 Speaking to the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, Yang Jiechi, who runs the party’s foreign affairs committee, said he had noted that some in the international community believed this was a geopolitical tool and would only bring debt traps for participating countries.
 
 “This obviously shows a lack of objectivity and fair understanding of the Belt and Road initiative. It is a misunderstanding, misjudgement and is even prejudiced,” wrote Yang, a former foreign minister and ambassador to Washington.
 
 China has stressed many times that the Belt and Road is to promote joint development, he added.
 
 “The Belt and Road is open, inclusive and transparent. It does not play little geopolitical games. It does not engage in the exclusion of exclusive small circles.”
 
 Yang noted that many countries, companies and ordinary people participating in the Belt and Road project had “publicly refuted rumours” about it being a debt trap.
 
 Belt and Road projects, from their selection to their financing, go through careful risk assessments and the initiative’s principles stress sustainable development, he said.
 
 “For cooperative partners who have debt difficulties, China’s principle is to appropriately resolve this through friendly consultations, and has never pushed or forced debt” on anyone, Yang added.
 
 To date no participating country has faced a debt crisis – to the contrary many countries have been able to escape the “no development trap”, he wrote.
 
 China will hold its second Belt and Road summit in Beijing in late April.
 
 Yang said almost 40 foreign leaders would take part, but did not name them.
 
 Some of China’s closest allies have already confirmed they will come, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.","['countries', 'critics', 'silk', 'debt', 'minister', 'belt', 'development', 'diplomat', 'chinas', 'yang', 'president', 'foreign', 'participating', 'prejudiced', 'road']","{'China': 6, 'Italy': 1, 'Cambodia': 1, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Philippines': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 BERLIN: China sought to ease Germany’s concerns over New Silk Road project and related initiatives, stressing that they are not intended to undermine the European Union.
 
 Speaking at a joint news conference with his German counterpart Heiko Maas on Thursday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s “16+1 initiative” with Central and Eastern European countries was aimed at contributing to economic growth, enhancing economic cooperation.
 
 “I would like to underline that we continue to support the integration process in Europe, we want the EU remain united and prosperous,” he said.
 
 Wang also underlined that they shared with Germany the vision of a multipolar world and of global free trade. “It is not in the interest of China to cause divisions between European states, we do not want to divide Europe,” he stressed. EU’s heavyweight Germany has been skeptical about China’s “16+1 cooperation”, and senior political figures openly criticized Beijing for seeking political influence with this initiative.
 
 The initiative, which brings together China, 11 EU member states and five Balkan states, has been part of Beijing’s ambitions “One Belt One Road” plan, also referred to as the New Silk Road. China has significantly increased its investments in the region, since it introduced the One Belt One Road initiative in 2013, which involves grand infrastructure projects to connect Eurasian countries with China.

 The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a bipartisan congressional panel charged with monitoring the security implications of US-China trade, has released a new report accusing China of using its Belt and Road Initiative development strategy as an excuse to establish military bases in other countries, Reuters reports.
 
 China’s strategy, adopted in 2013, led to the creation of a $5 trillion infrastructure and investment fund for Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. In September, Chinese President Xi Jinping committed some $60 billion in development aid and investment financing for Africa. In 2017, China established its first military base abroad in Djibouti, northeast Sub-Saharan Africa. For the record, the US has bases in at least 20 African countries, including Djibouti.
 
 According to the congressional panel, Congress should create a special fund to compete with China in countries where Beijing is “expanding its influence”, especially in the Indo-Pacific region.
 
 The commission also claims that China is using its road, highway, bridge, and port investments not only to “encourage and validate authoritarian actors abroad”, but of exporting technology standards which may threaten US companies’ market access.
 
 Asked to comment on the report, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she had not seen it, but stressed that China’s cooperation with other nations is based on the principles of mutual respect and mutual benefit.
 
 China welcomes US investment and other assistance in projects in these countries, Hua said, assuming that US intentions are “pure”. “We hope that when the US does this, their intentions are pure and the results are good,” she said.
 
 The panel also warned that in the US itself, China’s lead in 5G wireless technology is increasing the risk of cyber-attacks against US interests. “US telecommunications’ providers’ reliance on imports from China raises serious supply chain concerns about the secure deployment of US critical next generation telecommunications infrastructure,” its report noted.
 
 Relations between China and the United States took a turn for the worse following the introduction of several rounds of tariffs by the Trump administration affecting $250 billion in Chinese imports, as well as tensions in the South China Sea, where US warships have been holding ‘freedom of navigation’ missions to challenge Chinese territorial claims in the sea zone.","['countries', 'beijing', 'military', 'africa', 'chinese', 'belt', 'excuse', 'abroad', 'report', 'congress', 'accuses', 'using', 'china', 'congressional', 'panel', 'bases', 'road', 'investment']","{'China': 13, 'Djibouti': 2, 'Oman': 1, 'United States': 13}",,,,,

 The Chinese approach to a better future of humankind is based on the Chinese historical and cultural values with two fundamental ideas: community sharing and mutual connectivity. Prof. Wang Yiwei from China mentioned this in his keynote speech on ‘Belt and Road Initiative (BRI): Challenges and Way Forward’ delivered recently, at the auditorium of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), in Colombo.
 
 
 
 The speech on the BRI was organised jointly by the CCC and Pathfinder Foundation. CCC Chairman Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya and internationally respected expert on digital economy, Prof. Yiwei serves at the Renmin University of China and holds the Jean Monnet Chair Professorship.
 
 
 
 He is also Director of the Institute of International Affairs as well as Director of the Centre for European Studies at the university. Prof. Yiwei has in-depth knowledge on the BRI project and published books and articles extensively on the subject.
 
 
 
 High-quality global development
 
 As revealed at the keynote speech, the BRI is aimed at high-quality development of nations from the Far East to Europe, across Asia and Africa with open, green, clean and people-centred elements. According to the World Bank Report on Belt and Road Economics, the BRI transport projects could help lift 7.6 million people from extreme poverty with the current earning less than US $ 1.90 a day and 32 million people from moderate poverty with at present earning less than US $ 3.20 a day.
 
 
 
 It will also reduce shipping time for both the BRI countries and non-BRI countries, resulting in lower trade costs and trade expansion in the region. The largest estimated gains are for the trade routes connecting East and South Asia as well as along the corridors that are part of the BRI.
 
 
 
 The BRI is about interconnectivity of transportation in the air, on land and sea, oil and gas pipelines and telecommunications across 65 countries, connecting 4.4 billion on the planet of some seven billion people. It is a global transportation and other infrastructure network, comprising railways, highways, airlines, shipping lines, oil-gas, pipelines, power transmission lines and communication network.
 
 
 
 Ultimately, it is an economic corridor with integrated global development. The BRI can also be looked at as a project for reviving the Silk Road by international cooperation in order to build a Eurasian grand market. It brings about communities of two-thirds of the world population with shared interests, shared responsibilities and shared future.
 
 
 
 The priority areas of the project are diverse as infrastructure, industrial investment, resource development, economic and trade cooperation, financial cooperation, maritime cooperation, cultural exchange and ecological protection.
 
 Prof. Sirimal Abeyratne, Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya and Prof. Wang Yiwei
 
 
 
 Sri Lankan perspective
 
 The Sri Lankan perspective on the BRI was presented by Foreign Relations Additional Secretary to President Admiral Prof. Jayanath Colombage. More than half of the world’s container ships, one-third of bulk cargo traffic and two-thirds of global oil shipments use the Indian Ocean and much of which transits shipping lanes near Sri Lanka on the way through the Strait of Malacca to the South China Sea.
 
 
 
 It shows the potential of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean, connecting to the BRI. It is not only the locational advantage of the country but also the specific deep-water harbours around the island, which can accommodate any type of modern large ships that give it a unique edge.
 
 
 
 However, the Indian Ocean has now become the focal point for world powers – not only China but also the countries like the USA, Japan and our neighbouring India. Thus, the foreign policy is utmost important for the country’s future as well as for the security of the region. Given this background, Sri Lanka will remain close to its neighbour India and will adopt unbiased friendly relations with all other friendly countries.
 
 
 
 Business perspective
 
 The expectations of the business community of Sri Lanka from the BRI were presented by CCC Chief Economist Shiran Fernando. While the Hambantota port and the industrial zone as well as Colombo Port City are important projects that will have a major impact on the economy, according to the business community perspectives, the Colombo Port expansion, oil refinery projects and the industrial and export processing zones are the future projects of business importance.
 
 
 
 Facilitating joint ventures with Chinese investors and private sector involvement in the project as well as cooperation in the area of technology are viewed as preferred business initiatives for the private sector. Among the specific areas of interests, partnerships with Chinese firms to link with value chains, transshipment and value addition, reduced logistics and transport costs and increased market access are some of the areas highlighted by the business community.
 
 
 
 In this endeavour, they expect the government to invest in human resource development, to strengthen economic diplomacy, to build up international arbitration facility, to support setting up businesses in China and to maintain policy consistency.
 
 
 
 Open forum
 
 The open forum at the end of the speech was moderated by Prof. Sirimal Abeyratne of the University of Colombo. He acknowledges the fact that from a developing country point of view, the BRI connectivity is a choice for developing countries around it. They can choose either to get connected to it and benefit from it or to stay away from it confining their focus on their own affairs without benefitting from it.
 
 
 
 He also appreciated the detailed comprehensive analysis of the keynote speaker Prof. Yiwei; it was supplemented by the Sri Lankan government and business community perspectives.
 
 Professor Abeyratne invited Prof. Yiwei to comment on two controversial ideas that have been spread through international media as well as academic and political discussions. The first is the growing international concerns over the increased geopolitical tension in the Indian Ocean with the presence of world powers. The second is the accusations over the debt-trap in developing countries, which has been interpreted in connection with the Chinese projects.
 
 
 
 Prof. Yiwei clarified the commercial and development objective of the Chinese presence in any area of the world, which has nothing to do with any military strategy on the part of China.
 
 Secondly, he also explained the development assistance extended by China is on the request of the recipient countries that are well aware their external debt situation has the responsibility to put Chinese funding into productive use.
 
 
 
 Way forward
 
 Prof. Yiwei was also later interviewed by Pathfinder Foundation Founder Milinda Moragoda for prestigious talk show, Black & White. Subsequent discussions of the Pathfinder Foundation with Prof. Yiwei focused on the next level of the development projects in Sri Lanka, under the BRI.
 
 
 
 The areas earmarked included cooperation in maritime research, Chinese assistance to Sri Lanka’s technological and technical education, the need for attraction of high-end Chinese tourists and the production of films and TV programmes for China Global Television Network (CGTN).","['discuss', 'countries', 'chinese', 'belt', 'yiwei', 'cooperation', 'prof', 'business', 'sri', 'forward', 'initiatives', 'cccpathfinder', 'way', 'foundation', 'road', 'development', 'challenges', 'china', 'bri']","{'China': 8, 'India': 6, 'Japan': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 9, 'United States': 4}",,,,,

The defeat in the 1962 war, China’s economic, military and political support for Pakistan and incidents at the disputed border, as in Doklam in summer 2017, have contributed to India’s concerns vis-à-vis China.
 
 
 
 At the same time, China is India’s largest bilateral trading partner. Both states are also members of the BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), among others and they frequently take similar stances towards industrialised nations in international trade and climate negotiations.
 
 
 
 India, like China, has traditionally harboured ambitions to be a great power – for instance, for years it has demanded a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. India’s nuclear potential underlines its great power ambitions. However, unlike China, it only has the foreign policy resources of a middle power at best.
 
 
 
 Despite its strong economic growth in recent years, India was only ranked 131st on the 2015 Human Development Index (China was 90th). With about 900 people in its diplomatic service, a figure substantially lower than that of Japan or China, India is barely able to pursue its foreign policy initiatives.
 
 
 
 South Asia
 
 South Asia has traditionally been seen as India’s ‘natural’ sphere of influence. During the past few years, however, China has invested massively in the region as part of its Belt and Road Initiative. Its flagship project is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), under which China will support India’s regional archrival Pakistan with around US $ 54 billion until 2030.
 
 
 
 China invested around US $ 14 billion in infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka from 2005 to 2015. The Chinese government has pledged US $ 38 billion to Bangladesh and planned investments and credits for Nepal of more than US $ 8 billion.
 
 
 
 Indian security experts see India’s influence in the region to be dwindling as a consequence and fear the country will be encircled by Chinese bases (the so-called String of Pearls) in neighbouring states, including port projects in Gwadar (Pakistan) and Hambantota (Sri Lanka).
 
 
 
 Chinese investments in South Asia represent a challenge to which India’s foreign policy has not been able to find a suitable response. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did invite all the heads of government of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to his inauguration in May 2014 in order to emphasize the importance of his ‘Neighbourhood First’ Policy.
 
 
 
 However, despite some successes – for instance in relations with Bangladesh – this is still not an adequate response to Chinese investment in India’s neighbourhood. India is one of the few Asian states not taking part in China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
 
 
 
 A series of new developments points to a shift in India’s South Asia policy. In 2016, India and the US agreed on closer cooperation in their development policy towards third states, including the states in South Asia. Thus, in Afghanistan, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) supports the activities of the Indian women’s organisation Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA).
 
 
 
 India also cooperates with the United States on a project concerning transmission lines in Nepal and with Japan on constructing a liquid gas pipeline in Sri Lanka.
 
 
 
 These new forms of cooperation indicate a shift from India’s previous foreign policy, especially vis-à-vis the neighbouring states. Since its independence in 1947, India has seen itself as the primary regional power in South Asia. It has therefore used a wide range of political, economic and military means to intervene in the domestic political conflicts of its neighbours, including Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
 
 
 
 The Indira Doctrine, named after former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, stipulated that domestic political conflicts in the neighbouring states should be resolved exclusively with India’s help, without involving extra-regional great powers. From an Indian perspective, the record of these interventions is mixed at best. Despite its economic and military superiority, India has rarely managed to settle the neighbourhood conflicts in its own favour.
 
 
 
 All neighbouring states have tried – in various ways and with varying intensity – to internationalise their bilateral conflicts with India, usually through closer cooperation with the United States or China. Relations with India are a controversial topic in all neighbouring countries. Due to their religious, linguistic or ethnic common ground with India, issues of national identity always arise.
 
 
 
 Thus, the military regime in Bangladesh fostered the emergence of a Bangladeshi nationalism emphasising religion in the 1980s, thereby demarcating itself from Bengali nationalism, which stressed cultural similarities with India.
 
 
 
 In the 1990s, the economic liberalisation caused a change in India’s South Asia policy. Since then, the Indian governments have no longer seen the region purely in terms of security but increasingly also as part of the rapidly growing Indian market. Since the 2000s, India has relied on expanding regional connectivity to boost low levels of intra-regional trade.
 
 
 
 India’s new cooperation in the region with Western states and Japan also aims to counteract its dwindling influence through the creation of new formats. Thus, Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar declared that its smaller neighbours seemed to feel safer if there were also “other states in the room” alongside India. To that extent, the long-held belief that South Asia is India’s “natural” sphere of influence should gradually disappear.
 
 
 
 India’s extended neighbourhood in Asia
 
 India understands its extended neighbourhood to encompass the area between the Indian Ocean, Central Asia, East and Southeast Asia (see SWP-Studie 20/2016). Prime Minister Modi upgraded the “Look East” policy introduced in the 1990s to an “Act East” policy in 2014, in rivalry with China and to promote foreign trade. Its objective is to intensify economic, political and military relations with Japan and member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
 
 
 
 The shift in Indian commitment in its extended neighbourhood is evident in new or revived bilateral and multilateral formats. During US President Donald Trump’s Asia trip, he met the heads of government of Japan, Australia and India in Manila in November 2017 to revitalise the former quadrilateral initiative (quad). This group first coalesced 10 years earlier but has been unable to establish itself due to differences in foreign policy conceptions.
 
 
 
 As in 2007, the focus of the quad members is again on China. The states are looking for new ways to oppose China’s more assertive policies, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, foundation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and China’s rejection of the verdict delivered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague on the territorial conflicts in the South China Sea.
 
 
 
 India is very interested in reviving the quad and has markedly expanded its bilateral economic, military and political relations with the three other states in recent years. However, the quad members were unable to agree upon a common declaration at their meeting. Nor have they found a joint policy concerning maritime security and connectivity.
 
 
 
 An entirely new form of bilateral cooperation is the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC), wherein India and Japan are attempting to create a counter model to the Chinese BRI. The AAGC primarily targets the Indian Ocean and its coastal states.
 
 
 
 India has been promoting the idea of a security provider in the Indian Ocean since 2009. In the face of China’s increased presence, India has intensified its military cooperation with the island states of Mauritius, the Seychelles, Maldives and Comoros. In 2014, the Modi government created the Mausam project as a counterweight to BRI and since 2015 Modi has been promoting the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) concept.
 
 
 
 Compared to China, India has noticeably fewer political, economic and military resources at its disposal to implement its foreign policy ideas. Its close economic and political cooperation with Japan as part of the AAGC provides India with a new instrument for enforcing its ambitions in the Indian Ocean.
 
 
 
 The International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is a new trilateral project, which Russia, Iran and India have promulgated since 2015. The corridor, which begins at the Iranian port of Chabahar, is supposed to give India access to Afghanistan, Central Asia and Russia. As a result of its conflict with India, Pakistan has so far refused to allow an overland link to Central Asia and has blocked all attempts by Afghan governments to trade directly with India. In May 2016, the Indian government allocated US $ 500 million for developing Chabahar. The port city is only about 70 kilometres from the Pakistani port of Gwadar, where China’s ‘new Silk Road’ and ‘maritime Silk Road’ meet. In late October 2017, India shipped its first load of wheat to Afghanistan via Chabhar. The corridor should advance Indian-Afghan trade in the coming years. The Indian government thereby also underlines its ability to initiate successful infrastructure projects with other states.
 
 
 
 New opportunities for Germany and Europe
 
 In the face of China’s continued challenge, there is little doubt that India will continue to be significantly interested in cooperating with other states. Given its limited resources, it has fewer options for pursuing its objectives in economic policy or its strategic ambitions, which aim inter alia to establish a multipolar order in Asia.
 
 
 
 India’s cooperation with other states in South Asia is a novelty in its foreign policy. Within the extended neighbourhood, bilateral and minilateral formats provide a new set of instruments enabling India to take a stance against China in its foreign policy.
 
 
 
 This creates new opportunities for cooperation with India. Joint declarations at India’s summits with Italy, the European Union (EU) and Japan already contained relevant statements. The EU and India have moreover emphasised their willingness to cooperate militarily in the Indian Ocean, particularly off the coast of Somalia as part of Operation Atalanta.
 
 
 
 Among the EU member states, France maintains the closest relations with India in terms of security policy and has the greatest overlap with India in terms of geo-strategy. The two states have been strategic partners since 1998 and have long cultivated extensive cooperation in nuclear and armaments policy.
 
 
 
 France’s overseas departments, such as Réunion and its membership in the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), make it an essential European partner and an obvious choice for cooperation in the Indian Ocean.
 
 
 
 Germany has very good economic relations with India and has significantly expanded its business and technological contacts during the last few years. If India agreed to closer cooperation with third states in South Asia, it would share Germany’s interest in strengthening democratic and civil society structures in states such as Afghanistan or Nepal and in fighting growing religious extremism, for example in Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the Indian Ocean has also moved into Berlin’s foreign policy sights, increasing its economic and security convergence with New Delhi. By cooperating with India to promote the maritime economy or protect maritime resources in the Indian Ocean island states, Germany would play to everyone’s economic interests. This could also give a fresh impetus to India’s strategic partnership with the EU and its member states.

Indeed, stories about the BRI often include the evocation of debt ‘traps’ and ‘vassal states’. While some concerns merit consideration, popular criticisms of the BRI tend to be built upon incomplete and distorted stereotypes, which only draw attention away from the actual shortcomings of the BRI that need to be addressed.
 
 Common criticisms of the BRI are flawed in five important ways.
 
 
 
 First, they ignore how the impact of the BRI on a participating country depends upon the individual characteristics of the host country: things like a country’s credit rating, its domestic politics and its foreign currency reserves and the productivity of the BRI-related projects taking place there. The Centre for Global Development’s systematic study of the BRI found that 23 out of 68 countries that are hosting the BRI projects will be at risk of debt distress, due to a diverse range of domestic problems. These criticisms also ignore that the actualisation and design of the BRI projects depend on the dynamics of host-state elites. Large Chinese investments in the past have been cancelled or delayed due to domestic elite conflict, such as ICBC in the Philippines, Myanmar’s Myitsone Dam and Indonesia’s Jakarta–Bandung High-Speed Railway. The Philippines’ ZTE project was overpriced due to a host state politicians’ demand.
 
 
 
 Second, criticisms often point to the high interest rates on Chinese loans and the risks this may present to host countries, which is a red herring that distracts from the actual harmful impacts there might be. The common Chinese interest rate of 2 to 3 percent on concessional loans is still lower than commercial rates and Chinese loans are more flexible and expedient than those under Western aid. Chinese loans can be used for riskier projects, require less scrutiny and depend on the host state’s political relations with Beijing. Under certain conditions, these factors can perpetuate rent seeking and encourage irresponsible borrowing.
 
 
 
 Third, popular narratives of China’s foreign investment overlook the role of self-interested Chinese firms and host-state actors. Chinese firms sometimes take advantage of government financing to fund overpriced and badly assessed projects in order to profit from guaranteed material sourcing. For instance, a World Bank-blacklisted Chinese company made a bid for Marawi’s reconstruction after the siege of the city in 2017 and got the approval of the Philippine government. While China has started to limit outbound outflows that don’t have government approval and is taking money laundering more seriously, many Chinese actors evade their country’s regulations. Indeed, Patrick Ho, a member of the CEFC China Energy-backed China Energy Fund Committee, was arrested in November 2017 in the United States on charges of allegedly bribing government officials in Chad and Uganda.
 
 
 
 The host-state firms also use their national government networks to get Chinese funding and Chinese partners often go along with such operations. This tends to occur in countries with significant local government deregulation. These projects become overpriced and economically less viable or worse, they operate illegally for profit.
 
 
 
 In these cases, neither the Chinese state nor the host state gains from the project’s completion due to the enormous overhead costs and negative social impact. In response to these issues, the Chinese government has centralised aid-investment decisions, has investigated higher standards of environmental assessment and has begun discussions on consultation mechanisms with civil society in host countries.
 
 
 
 Fourth, critics argue that the BRI deliberately targets countries to generate military concessions. While this remains a possibility in the future, their recent examples have relied on hearsay. China’s and Vanuatu’s governments both denied the reports of a military base being built in Vanuatu.
 
 
 
 Finally, this criticism ignores the urgent demand of the developing world for infrastructure capital. Since the end of the Cold War, Western institutions have recalibrated overseas development aid to fund social development and begun demanding governance or political reforms as conditions for funding. These conditions place unreasonable constraints upon the developing world, whose governments have weaker capacity, tighter budgetary constraints and more limited tenure to perform than their developed-country counterparts.
 
 
 
 There are, however, some empirically supportable objections to the BRI.
 
 China’s falling rate of profitability on domestic investments has led to its increased foreign investment activity. Economic necessity to pursue profits abroad, bolstered by the BRI, may limit China’s willingness to reform domestically, disrupt the balance of influence among international financial institutions and hinder the capacity of host states to refuse desperately needed aid. In other words, China and its capitalists may disrupt any momentum of reform.
 
 
 
 There is also no standardised procedure on how to proceed when a BRI-financed project fails. Answers to questions about who pays the loans, how much should be paid and what happens to the initial investments remain vague. Case-by-case bilateral negotiations with China seem to be the default option but specifying these at the outset is important to avoid more worrisome political returns.
 
 Another worrying trend is that in some cases, China has asked for equity in these projects or strategic infrastructure acquisitions in return for debt forgiveness. While China will assume the projects’ risks, these infrastructure projects will give China greater capacity to project geostrategic power in the host state, which could lead to militarisation.
 
 
 
 The final issue is China’s geopolitical ambition alongside the BRI. While seeking economic leverage is not unique to China, the simultaneous increased projection of military power can generate regional insecurities, like in the newly installed missiles in the South China Sea. To remedy this, stronger regional bodies with channels for coordination and communication can open the lines for further dialogue. It is crucial for ASEAN and other supporting states to come together and challenge China at the negotiating table, push for concessions and constrain China’s tendencies for expansion.
 
 
 
 The scale, scope and complexity of the BRI mean that there are substantial risks, for China and for host countries. But rather than focussing on red herrings, a more nuanced conversation about the BRI will do more to help resolve these underlying issues.

 “The debt sustainability issue of Belt and Road (projects) is a complicated issue, but we will take care of it,” Zou told a panel on the sidelines of annual International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Indonesia.
 
 She said China could optimize and diversify its Belt and Road debt financing with more foreign direct investment, public-private partnerships, and equity investment, as opposed to commercial loans that could be more expensive.
 
 However, the Reuters reported that the initiative has been met with growing scepticism as some countries, such as Sri Lanka, became saddled with debt that they had difficulty in repaying.
 
 One of the top recipients of China’s largesse, Malaysia, has recently stopped work on a $20 billion rail link between its east and west coasts, a rare setback for the Belt and Road initiative.
 
 Zou said the Chinese government fully respects Malaysia’s decision-making and judgment, stressing the projects were inked on a commercial basis, and countries are free to vet and evaluate the terms of the projects.
 
 “Malaysia adequately communicated with the China side on the issue.

 Our politicians hire smart professionals and tell them what to do rather than get them to tell what we should
 
 The above ne ws item appeared in on May 6 wherein it says: “The MoU signed by Minister Dissanayake and Executive Governor of the People’s Government of Hainan Province aims at rejuvenating Sri Lanka’s ailing plantation sector that comprises of tree crops including rubber, tea, coconut, cashew, sugar cane and related industrial value chains.” It also says: “The projects are to be designed based on the Sri Lanka Rubber Industry Development Master Plan which is a 10-year growth plan aimed at earning USD 4-5 billion from the rubber industry. Beginning from 2019, Chinawill field competent teams to conduct project feasibility studies across the industry value chains with participation of Sri Lankan private sector and government resource personnel.
 
 
 
 Rubber is planted in most Southeast Asian regions, Thailand, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka to name a few major countries and China is not listed as a rubber producing country. If so, why does China take such an interest in Sri Lanka’s rubber industry? In saying so, browsing through inter-net, this is what it says on the Rubber Research Institute, Sri Lanka [RRI] – “The Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka is the oldest research institution on rubber in the world and it is the model agency in Sri Lanka with statutory responsibility for research and development on all aspects of rubber cultivation and processing for the benefit of the rubber industry.” And its mission is to revitalise the rubber sector by developing economically, environmentally sustainable innovations and transferring the latest technology to shareholders through training and advisory services. If that were the vision and the duty of RRI, it is pertinent to question as to why we require Chinese assistance. Is it due to our failure to perform, due to government’s failure to fund this institution or lack of knowledgeable professionals?
 
 On the other hand, Thailand and Indonesia are the top-most rubber producing countries and surely these countries may have done advanced research to keep abreast with the world’s demand. If so, why have we not approached these countries for assistance in the way of consultancies and technologies? There lies the hidden secret where China, as I said in one of my letters which appeared in on March 12 titled ‘China’s Modus Operandi to Dominate Asian Region as Feared by Some’ where China tries to gain a foothold in a country’s affairs by funding projects which are not viable as in the case of Hambantota Harbour, Mattala Airport, sports stadium in Wirawila in Sri Lanka and in Kenya, Zambia and Republic of Congo.
 
 One major reason in our country to be subjected to bad governance is when our professionals do not speak out, but worse still, our professionals actually gang up with those committing anarchy for their own benefit
 
 It was recently reported that the Republic of Congo was seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund [IMF] to pay off Chinese loans to get out of China’s debt grip. When a country fails to repay the loans with interest, China takes over the projects and run same. We narrowly escaped one such move when China wanted to take over and run Norochcholai Coal Power Plant which with the advice of CEB engineers, the then minister of power and energy, flatly refused. Now it appears China has shown interest in our plantation industry, a vital sector bringing in foreign exchange. Our government must carefully study and seek other avenues for consultancy and funding to revive our rubber industry, if internal funding were not possible and local professionals are unavailable. Surely, our private owners, old rubber planters having a wealth of experience and agencies of rubber estates, if given some incentive, could come out to solve the problem. It is a shame to show to the world we have no professionals in this field when during the colonial regime this industry was well-nurtured with dedication.
 
 
 
 In the recent past, governments looked to other countries for professional guidance at a cost when we have our own. I remember, while in public service, when foreign consultants were engaged, they first go through the findings and recommendations of our own professionals and then make a few alterations or suggestions to justify their engagement. Our professionals too would want outsiders to confirm their findings. One truthful statement made at this forum is ‘Sri Lanka must upgrade its outdated technological infrastructure both soft and hard, modernise its human capital in work ethics and competencies and also adopt new breakthrough management models to serve the global markets emerging with seamless disruptive effects.’ Is this truthful finding possible in Sri Lanka when politicians interfere?
 
 
 
 One major reason in our country to be subjected to bad governance is when our professionals do not speak out, but worse still, our professionals actually gang up with those committing anarchy for their own benefit. What they seem not to realise is that in the long run, they too would be subjected to worst treatment by politicians whom they have protected. Has this not been proved where our top officials are facing court cases for fraud, committed to please politicians?

 In the two days of meetings from 8 November between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Trump’s first state visit, it appears that they did not talk at all about the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
 
 
 
 Trump’s tour reflected the tendency of his administration to see Asia entirely through the lens of bilateral ties and crises. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump have stated that the United States seeks to sustain and protect a free and open Indo-Pacific, but the inability to match that concept with either a meaningful strategic vision or substantive policy was plainly on display.
 
 
 
 Strategic thinking
 
 
 
 This absence of strategic thinking about the region is a key reason for the neglect of China’s BRI. It is a policy that is monumental in scale, highly strategic in its outlook and reflects Xi’s confident and ambitious vision of China’s global role.
 
 
 
 If the United States and its allies want to maintain the underlying economic and strategic status quo in Asia, they need to recognize that they will be doing so at the same time that China is forging ahead with its BRI plans.
 
 
 
 The initiative was first announced in a pair of speeches given by Xi in 2013 in Kazakhstan and Bandung, setting out a sweeping but vague vision for improved connectivity between China and the former Silk Road Corridor. At the recent 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the initiative was written into the party’s constitution. It is without question the most important element in China’s international policy.
 
 
 
 At its core, the BRI is about the practical business of connecting peoples and markets through infrastructure. But it also has at least five different strategic functions.
 
 More than 60 countries have signed memorandums of understanding with China about the BRI
 
 
 
 Perhaps the most immediate of these is that it is a means to drive economic growth in China’s deprived southern and western provinces. The aim is both to reduce the huge economic inequalities between the Chinese hinterlands and the coast and to provide a social developmental anchor for parts of China that the CCP has long seen as restive and resistant to Beijing rule. A more prosperous Xinjiang is, from this view, less likely to be susceptible to the allure of ‘terrorism and separatism’.
 
 But huge investment in infrastructure is not just about levelling out economic prospects within China: the initiative also aims to improve economic development prospects in China’s western periphery. The China–Pakistan Economic Corridor — a sprawling program of pipelines, dams and development projects in Pakistan — is not so much about bringing hydrocarbons from the Arabian Sea to Xinjiang. Rather, it is about improving Pakistan’s welfare. A well-off Pakistan is a better market for Chinese goods, a more reliable partner to balance Indian influence and is less likely to be a source of radical Islamist inspiration. That the economic improvement among China’s neighbours would also align those countries’ interests with Beijing’s is an added bonus.
 
 
 
 Creating more developed markets
 
 
 
 This will also help create more developed markets to consume the higher-end manufactured goods that China’s economic reformers aim to create. Importantly, as those markets along the Belt and Road are developed they are also intended to have Chinese industrial standards to become internationalised, further entrenching China’s economic advantage. As the United States knows, countries that build infrastructure also set the standards.
 
 
 
 A fourth motive — and perhaps one that has been the most prominent in the minds of China hawks — is the BRI’s geopolitics. China’s dependence on its maritime approaches and their vulnerability to US power has long been a source of concern for the Party leadership. The US navy’s submarine fleet is likely to ensure that even if China were to ‘leapfrog’ aircraft carrier development, the country would remain susceptible to US naval predation. By pivoting west and being able to access markets via continental means, China can overcome the maritime choke points that create submarine vulnerability, thereby gaining much needed strategic depth.
 
 
 
 Massive infrastructure
 
 
 
 Finally, in developing the BRI’s US$1 trillion infrastructure programme that binds states and economies into a China-centred economic and strategic system, China is aiming to weaken existing strategic and institutional structures. In short, the BRI is a crucial part of China’s incremental and non-threatening construction of a new regional order. The symbolism could not be clearer from Beijing: we are building bridges, ports and pipelines while you, the United States, are building walls.
 
 
 
 More than 60 countries have signed memorandums of understanding with China about the BRI, yet many others (particularly those close to the United States) remain sceptical. Australia seems genuinely perplexed as to how to respond, while Japan’s recent cautious approval is the public face of a very sceptical Japanese government. This uncertainty is understandable.
 
 The initiative was first announced in a pair of speeches given by Xi in 2013 in Kazakhstan and Bandung
 
 
 
 From a US ally point of view, the BRI is a genuinely puzzling program. The region badly needs infrastructure investment and China has the capital, experience and capability to drive this forward. But the initiative will almost certainly increase China’s relative strength and further erode the old regional order. As a project in which the geopolitical cannot be disentangled from the economic, it also frustrates more conventional approaches to international policy.
 
 
 
 The BRI’s close association with President Xi means that it is going to be the most important component of China’s international policy over the coming decade. Equally, as it unfolds it will significantly alter strategic and economic relationships in the region. More broadly, the BRI reflects an ambition to fill in the missing piece of the connectivity puzzle that will create a more China-centred regional order.
 
 
 
 The question is whether the United States will contest China’s efforts or be too busy with its own travails to even realise that there is a competition. If Trump’s first nine months in office are any indication, China has the field wide opens.

Such a network, as envisioned by Chinese President Xi Jinping, had a soft launch in Beijing in April this year. Called the Belt and Road News Network (BRNN), it seeks to boost “understanding, friendship and cooperation, and form a normalised mechanism for collaboration” across countries which are members of the trillion dollar BRI network.
 
 In promoting this networking programme, the Islamabad-based Center for Global & Strategic Studies (CGSS) last week organised an international conference on “Cross-Regional Media Fusion among the Belt and Road Partners”. Journalists from Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Iran, Kyrgyz Republic, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan took part in the conference.
 
 Prime Minister Imran Khan’s special advisor on media affairs, Dr. Firdous Ashiq Awan, was the chief guest. She said Chinese President Xi Jinping’s BRI vision was a harbinger of a new era of connectivity and would bridge the gap between the North and the South. “The BRI and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) are reshaping the geo-economic landscape and bringing not only prosperity for Pakistan but shared development for the entire region,” she said
 
 Dr. Firdous said she appreciated the positive role of the Pakistani media in eliminating the negative propaganda against the CPEC.
 
 Pang Chunxue, Deputy Chief of Mission at the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad, told the conference China, as the engine of world economic growth, had brought more opportunities for shared development for all BRI partners. “China is building a new model that features no conflict, rejects cold war, power politics and creates win-win situations for all. China has promoted peaceful diplomacy and cooperation that aims at building a world with shared prosperity. In a nutshell, peace and stability is the need of the time and the BRI is important to achieve this goal,” she said.
 
 
 
 Visions and goals are one thing, but the ground reality is totally another. Asymmetry is the salient feature of the BRI, be it development or media freedom.
 
 On matters development, the BRI can bring in the anticipated fusion with investment flowing in from the Centre – China – to the periphery or other BRI partner states. Any Centre-Periphery relationship kindles memories of the colonial era that existed from the 16th century to the mid 20th century. Therefore, the burden is on China to allay suspicion that the BRI is not aimed at recreating a neocolonialist world order. What is encouraging to see is that China has been categorical in denying that it has any neocolonial agenda.
 
 The Chinese delegation at the conference was emphatic in its assertion that China did not harbor expansionist ideas through the BRI. It is on such assurances that the BRI media network is trying to make linkages among partner country journalists. Just as with development and economic progress, there is asymmetry in media structures of partner countries. Certainly, Sri Lanka’s media development is not similar to that of China. On the Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontiers’ Press Freedom Index for 2019, Sri Lanka is placed 126th while China is placed 177th. Pakistan is 142, Belarus 153, Kazakhstan 158 and Uzbekistan is 160.
 
 
 
 With vast disparities in media freedom, the BRI media network is not going to be like the media linkages Sri Lanka had with the British Commonwealth which through the now defunct Commonwealth Press Union tried to promote media freedom, democracy and human rights.
 
 Then there were moves to set up South Asian media linkages within the framework of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation. Due to SAARC’s structural weaknesses, media connectivity proposals are gathering dusts in the SAARC archive. The BRI media network President Xi seeks to activate is also far from the New Information Order which developing countries sought to bring about during the heydays of the Non-Aligned Movement.
 
 Unlike most BRI nations, Sri Lanka has a long tradition of independent media culture. The arrival of the printing press in the country in 1737 during the Dutch colonial period laid the foundation for an early print media culture in Sri Lanka.
 
 The Sri Lanka print media’s early development had its origins in the work of European missionaries and measures taken by the Sinhala Buddhists and the Hindu Tamils to resist it. This daunting task and the challenges faced by the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims defined the shape and tone of the media throughout its subsequent history in the runup to Independence in 1948.
 
 ""In a nutshell, peace and stability is the need of the time and the BRI is important to achieve this goal""
 
 
 
 Our independence struggle was largely non-violent, with the media playing a significant role in awakening the people and rallying them for freedom.
 
 But after Independence in 1948, press freedom suffered. Soon, there emerged three streams of media: The objective media, the state-owned media and the privately owned partisan media. This is virtually the good, the bad and the ugly of Sri Lanka’s journalism even today.
 
 Due to our colonial past, Sri Lanka’s media culture has an inbuilt aversion to imperialism. Sri Lanka also has an active socialist political movement that has resisted Western nation’s neo-colonialist efforts to bring Sri Lanka under their control.
 
 Given this backdrop, the independent segment of the Sri Lanka’s media is suspicious of big powers’ agenda in Sri Lanka, although our history shows that Sri Lanka has benefited from trade with foreign nations, including China.
 
 Such suspicion exists, notwithstanding China’s help to Sri Lanka through the Rubber-Rice agreement in 1952, the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall which stands as a monument for friendship and values the two countries share in promoting global justice, and the ongoing BRI flagship projects such as the Hambantota Port and the Colombo Financial City development. Besides, the BRI is not incompatible with Sri Lanka’s economic vision of making its key ports the regional and international hub of trade
 
 and investment.
 
 
 
 As China’s interactions and trade relations with Sri Lanka send mixed signals, media focus on the BRI is imperative to ensure that Sri Lanka’s interests are not undermined. It is in this context, a wider BRI media network is necessary and China, too, recognizes it. Through media linkages, the BRI partner countries can share their experiences in addressing suspicion and concerns over BRI network’s weaker countries falling into what the Western nations describe as China’s debt trap.
 
 There are positives, too, apart from the BRI’s negativities, especially the viewpoint that it was the modern day East India Company that paved the way for Britain to colonise the Indian subcontinent.
 
 Nations avoid wars and give priority to peaceful means of conflict resolution, when they are bound by mutually beneficial trade. The United Nations has acknowledged that trade plays a major role in alleviating global poverty. Then there is China’s foreign policy stand which is also compatible with those of developing nations.
 
 Therefore, media in BRI partner countries can play an important role in promoting not only mutually beneficial and compatible economic visions, but also shared values aimed at world peace.
 
 Trade and cultural exchanges enhance friendship between nations and people-to-people contacts. The BRI media network can emerge as a global movement for peace and development journalism.","['countries', 'peace', 'development', 'network', 'media', 'nations', 'lanka', 'lankas', 'china', 'bri', 'sri']","{'Azerbaijan': 1, 'Belarus': 2, 'China': 17, 'India': 2, 'Kazakhstan': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 18, 'Mali': 1, 'Pakistan': 4, 'Tajikistan': 1, 'Uzbekistan': 2}",,,,,

 Over the last few years, both economic and historical ties between Sri Lanka and China have grown with China becoming a significant economic partner of Sri Lanka. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is at the centre of this. The Chinese government has invested large sums to develop infrastructure and trade routes for what it believes is a mutually beneficial programme.
 
 
 
 The BRI has five key objectives, namely, policy coordination, connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people bonds. However, one of the primary challenges the initiative has faced includes obtaining the support and cooperation of other emerging economies, mainly India. Western powers also remain sceptical of the initiative and view it as means of China increasing its geopolitical power and influence.
 
 
 
 BRI in Sri Lanka
 
 The BRI programme is split between two main initiatives - a revitalised land route between China and Europe via Russia or the ‘Silk Road Economic Belt’ (the Belt) and the ‘Maritime Silk Road’ (the Road), which aims to connect a multitude of countries via new sea routes and infrastructure.
 
 
 
 Sri Lanka’s involvement has largely been with the latter of these initiatives given its geographical location in the middle of the Indian Ocean, with an emphasis on Sri Lanka becoming a hub facilitating easy transit of goods from China to Sri Lanka and other Southeast Asian economies and beyond.
 
 
 
 To this effect, the majority of the BRI investments in Sri Lanka have been to facilitate this maritime effort and a number of major infrastructure projects have been kicked off. Under the BRI project, Sri Lanka has currently secured up to US $ 8 billion of financing from China.
 
 
 
 The CIFC, formerly known as the Colombo Port City, is an instrumental part of China’s BRI and aims to build a new city and financial centre along the existing Colombo coastline that will serve as Sri Lanka’s financial and business district by 2030.
 
 
 
 Another important initiative is the Hambantota port and adjoining industrial estate. Sri Lanka is located at a strategic point for the BRI. The port of Hambantota is indispensable for China’s energy security because the country imports two-thirds of its oil through shipping lanes south of the port. This initiative was aimed to build a secondary port at the coastal town of Hambantota, to alleviate capacity and crowding concerns with the primary port in Colombo.
 
 
 
 In addition to this, the latest investment gives China control over 15,000 acres of land adjacent to the port for the development of an industrial zone in Hambantota. The feasibility study for the industrial park identified the development of shipping services, processing of seafood, agricultural products and other processing/manufactured industries as potential ventures.
 
 
 
 Another BRI project in Sri Lanka is the expansion and modernisation of the Colombo port - Colombo International Container Terminal, a Sino-Sri Lanka joint venture.
 
 In addition to seaports, China has also funded the construction of airports. Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) is located in Hambantota, 241 km south-east of Sri Lanka’s capital city, Colombo. MRIA is the second international airport in Sri Lanka.
 
 
 
 Implications of BRI for Sri Lanka
 
 The BRI holds out the prospect of helping to bridge the significant infrastructure financing gap, increase connectivity, link local markets to regional and global value chains and thereby increase trade and investment in the participating countries.
 
 
 
 Higher trade flows can be one of the important gains. As the world’s second largest economy, China is one of the biggest traders in the world. While Sri Lanka is not an important trading partner of China, China has emerged to become Sri Lanka’s second largest trading partner after India, in terms of Sri Lanka’s total trade with the world. Initiatives, such as the BRI will enhance trade routes between both countries and facilitate trade bilaterally and beyond.
 
 
 
 Attracting more foreign direct investment can be a big gain, which remains a priority for Sri Lanka. As part of the BRI, there have been significant Chinese investments in Sri Lanka already. The existing investments in Sri Lanka as part of the BRI amount to approximately US $ 8 billion, while China has offered up to an additional US $ 24 billion in financing.
 
 
 
 For countries needing infrastructure, the BRI holds the promise of investment in new railways, roads, ports and other projects, improving connectivity within and between countries.
 
 
 
 However, making success of the BRI will require more than just building physical infrastructure. Soft infrastructure is critical, which means facilitating the movement of people, goods and services across borders.
 
 
 
 However, navigating power rivalries and geopolitics will be more challenging. Currently, Sri Lanka is walking a tight rope, seeking economic and other benefits from China under the BRI while maintaining close relations with its rivals, the US, Japan and India. The BRI has raised concerns of China’s intentions in the Indian Ocean, given the ambitions of the plan. Not surprisingly, India is not a party to the BRI.
 
 
 
 The implications of the BRI for a country’s autonomy and sovereignty are matters of concern as well. With a significant portion of investment and funding in the BRI coming from Chinese public entities, there is concern that a growing debt burden can lead to weaker negotiating strength and loss of sovereignty.
 
 
 
 With the ownership of key central infrastructure (e.g. the ports) being tied to such entities, Sri Lanka sacrifices a level of autonomy around how to manage this infrastructure. Indeed, China’s takeover of the troubled Hambantota port has raised questions about loss of sovereignty arising from large debt-to-equity swap arrangements.

 The main investment projects are concentrated on infrastructure constructions which are directly under the broader framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Currently, the key investment projects in Sri Lanka include Colombo International Financial City, Colombo International Container Terminals and Hambantota Port. Also, Chinese privateinvestments in Sri Lanka has grown rapidly. Chinese private enterprises mainly invest in hotel construction, agricultural product processing, manufacturing, warehouse logistics etc.
 
 
 
 The historical foundation of the China-Sri Lanka relations has laid exchanges on cultural, commercial and trade relations. The famous Sino-Lanka Rubber Rice Pact in 1952 officially commenced a strong bilateral economic and trade partnership allowing to strengthen diplomatic ties among the two countries. With China’s expertise hard and soft infrastructure construction such as roads and highways, value added agricultural products, construction of ports and related industries, Sri Lanka could maneuver the potential opportunities gained through establishing mutual cooperation among the two nations. This article has identified key areaswhere China and Sri Lanka could mutually benefit through cooperating in areas such as;value added agriculture, infrastructure construction, developing ports and related activities, upgrading local manufacturing industries and tourism development.
 
 
 
 Towards value-added agriculture
 
 Under the influence of the tropical monsoon climate, Sri Lanka has abundant rainfall, fertile land, and a wealth of tropical economic crops. SriLanka has favorable conditions for the development of the agricultural sector. In addition, Sri Lanka is rich in fisheries, forestry and water resources. Sri Lanka’s arable land area accounts for 61% of the country’s land area. It has a large area of rubber gardens, tea gardens and coconut gardens. These three types of agricultural products are the three pillars of Sri Lanka’s agricultural economic income.
 
 
 
 Export of agricultural products accounts for a section around 25 percent of the total export earning of the country. In recent years, Sri Lanka’s share of spices exports has gradually increased, becoming a major emerging industry in Sri Lanka’s agricultural exports. At the same time, Sri Lanka is also the world’s third largest producer of black tea and the largest exporter.
 
 
 
 In order to improve the international competitiveness, the Sri Lankan government has pointed out that increasing investment in research and development of agriculture and improving the quality of their agricultural products. Under the influence of this national policy background, China can strengthen cooperation with Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector, especially in the fields of tea, coconut and rubber. Sri Lanka is the world’s leading coconut producer, and its output is second only to India, the Philippines and Indonesia. China can strengthen cooperation with Sri Lanka in coconut production and deep processing, which can increase the added value of coconuts and related products.
 
 
 
 Modernizing infrastructure
 
 According toSri Lankan development goals, the Sri Lankan government points out that, it should continue to strengthen its investments in developing infrastructure and increase the annual investment by 30 percent to 35 percent which in return will drive the growth of the national economy.
 
 
 
 Upgrading domestic roads
 
 At this stage, there are three highways in Sri Lanka that are: the southern expressway from Colombo to Matra, the Colombo Airport Expressway, and the first phase of the Colombo Expressway. According to the Sri Lanka government’s national highway development plan, highways currently under construction include the Colombo Outer circular Expressway project and the original Southern Expressway extending the original road network to Hambantota Port and Hambantota International Airport.
 
 
 
 In addition to the highways mentioned above, the highways from the Kadawata to Dambulla in the central region and the expressways from Colombo to Rathnapura are undergoing preliminary preparations.
 
 
 
 At present, China’s domestic highways are developing rapidly and the researches on road construction technology have matured.
 
 
 
 China’s railway construction began in the Qing Dynasty. After more than a century of expertise in railway construction and development, at the end of 2016, China’s railways had a total mileage of 124,000 kilometres, ranking second in the world. Among them, 25,000 kilometres of high-speed railways ranked first in the world. The national railway double-track rate and electrification rate reached 54.9 percent and 64.8 percent respectively. Strengthening cooperation with Sri Lanka railways on the one hand will help ease the slow development of the Sri Lankan railway freight mileage and solve the people’s livelihood problem in Sri Lanka; On the other hand, it will help to develop advanced technology for China’s railways and to promote the Chinese railway construction standards to the world. So the cooperation between China and Sri Lanka is win-win cooperation.
 
 
 
 From port to city and provincial development
 
 The Sri Lankan government has already taken measures to develop port construction and development of industrial parks with an intention to increase exports and improve the value addition of its export products. At present, the Sri Lankan government manages a number of export processing zones and it is also learned that a couple of privately-owned industrial zones are also managed. They are located in the economically developed Western and Central provinces. The port industry involves a wide range of diversified industries. In addition to the most basic loading and unloading functions of the port, there are a number of related industries, such as the maritime industry and transportation.
 
 
 
 Chinese expertise in the construction of ports and managing industrial parks is well demonstrated under the framework of ‘Shekou mode’ also known as Port-Park-City (PPC) model. Followed by China’s open reforms and economic policy by the chief architect Deng Xiaoping in 1978, Shekou, a small fishing village in Shenzhen was transformed into an industrial zone in 1979. With an area of ​​2.14 square kilometres and a population of few thousands, Shekou Industrial Zone was constructed by the China Merchants Group and is the first export-oriented, industrial zone. Today, the Shekou industrial zone has become an international coastal new city with a population of 400,000 and a per capita GDP of more than US$ 60,000.
 
 
 
 The first phase of the Shekou mode or the Port-Park-City mode is to build the port and mainly based on developing a multi-purpose port to accommodate large vessels to receive bulk cargo. Construction of an industrial park with logistics and an export processing zone are a few components of the next phase.
 
 
 
 This development process will end up building a modern city with facilitating technological innovations.China Merchant Holdings have used the experience of Shekou to transform African port of Djibouti making use of its geographical advantage into an international hub for maritime cargo making.
 
 
 
 At present, the Djibouti International free trade zone with an overseas park has benefited from this model which has made breakthroughs and is expected to promote local development into a ‘Shekou of East Africa’ that integrated functions of finance, logistics and trade. After the operations of the new port commences, Djibouti aims to build a modern business district which is fully equipped with commercial and tourism facilities. It is important to understand that, mega infrastructure projects such as the construction of ports and industrial parks should not only be port-centric or park-centric. These approaches may not deliver the guaranteed results but unless these become international trading hubs which will sustain in the longer run. An industrial park consist of a special economic zone will boost inward investments and trade. On the other hand, industrial parks enable connectivity to global supply chains which in return will add value to local exports and contribute to cargo generation.
 
 
 
 PPC model
 
 Taking the experience of Shekou and Djibouti into practice, the port of Hambantota will be built according to the PPC model. The Sri Lankan government has announced thatan investment of 3.85 billion US dollars in the southern Hambantota refinery will start its construction. A cement plant project with an investment of US$100 million was started in parallel with the refinery project. These two projects are expected to create a large number of employment opportunities and have positive implications for stimulating local economic development.
 
 
 
 Benefitting from Chinese industrial capacity relocation
 
 Due to lack of its resource capacity, Sri Lanka depends heavily on import of raw materials. The textile and garment industry accounts for a significant contribution to the overall industrial composition. The textile and clothing industry accounted for 45.9 percent of Sri Lanka’s major export commodities in 2015. Sri Lanka hopes to promote the development of the Sri Lankan secondary industry through an agreement with the China Free Trade Zone, especially the relatively weak manufacturing and equipment manufacturing in Sri Lanka. Industry is also a key area of Sri Lanka’s major industrial development goals.
 
 
 
 The establishment of the China-Sri Lanka Free Trade Zone will help to increase the manufacturing capacity of Sri Lanka and help the development of its secondary industry. With regard to the cooperation between China and Sri Lanka in the manufacturing sector, Sri Lanka’s industries with advantages in development at this stage are labor-intensive, especially in the textile field, and China can transfer some of its production capacity in related fields.
 
 
 
 Chinese companies intending to invest in Sri Lanka’s textile manufacturing industry should give priority to areas in Sri Lanka where the transportation is convenient, where the population density is relatively high, and the southern provinces, and at the same time they negotiate details with the relevant departments of Sri Lanka and have targeted investment options. Today, China occupies a leading position in the global textile industry. It is not only the country with the largest production scale but also the country with the most complete industrial chain with prominence to global value chains.Data show that in 2017, China’s chemical fiber production reached 4,915,500 tons, accounting for more than 70 percent of the world’s total; the total production of garments The total production of garments accounts for 28.78 billion which is equivalent to 6.89 garments per person.
 
 
 
 As a traditional industry of the ‘Silk Road’, China’s textile industry is actively integrated into the BRI actively establishing cooperation with countries along the belt and road realizing the internationalization of productivity and supply chain through green investment, through raw materials, brands, Cross-regional cooperation in resources such as channels and R&D to achieve cooperation and development with Sri Lanka.
 
 
 
 Chinese tourism-led growth
 
 Sri Lanka’s natural and cultural tourism resources are abundant. Before the end of the civil war, the development of the country’s inbound tourism was slow and was less-attractive to the foreign market. Soon after the end of the war, Sri Lanka’s tourism industry began to recover becoming the most famous destination in the whole of South Asia. With the increase of the awareness of the potential merits highlighted in China’s belt and road initiative, Sri Lanka has made a positive response and is willing to support the initiative.
 
 
 
 In May 2016, China and Sri Lanka signed a memorandum of cooperation in tourism. It should be noted that, China is the world’s largest outbound tourist market which can allow countries like Sri Lanka to gain access to the world’s largest outbound market. The Sri Lankan government could introduce more favorable reforms to improve the quality of its tourism industry to attract high-end tourists around the world.
 
 
 
 Similarly, China is the second largest tourist source market for Sri Lanka. With the concept of BRI coastal and ocean tourism has set off a new wave in China. The long-standing friendship among China and Sri Lanka has promoted the enthusiasm of Chinese tourists to select Sri Lanka as a must-see tourist destination in South Asia.Sri Lanka has beach tourism around the sea in terms of natural tourism resources, alpine tea garden tours, gem tours, historic culture of Buddhism in cultural tourism, ancient colonial ruins, local ethnic culture, dance and musical heritage few other aspects. Each has its own characteristics and is one of the key industries in Sri Lanka. So the development and construction of new tourist attractions are also the focus of national development.
 
 
 
 Tourism is a comprehensive industry, which is will promote the progress of a series of related industries. Transportation infrastructure, hotels, restaurants, communications and private services will all be driven to a certain extent. The national goal of Sri Lanka is to develop a service-oriented economy and tourism will greatly promote the progress of a series of related industries including the service industry. Chinese related companies intend to invest Sri Lanka and can adapt to the trend of tourism development to invest in the development and construction of new tourist attractions. In line with the current state of aviation and transportation development in Sri Lanka, it is recommended that Chinese companies choose to travel in the east and south.
 
 
 
 In the past five years, China and Sri Lanka have made important progress in negotiating and joining hands for the belt and road initiative. Sri Lanka is located in the middle of the Silk Road and has a very advantageous geographical position. The proposal of the Belt and Road strategy is a good opportunity for Sri Lanka. China’s current development is like a fast-moving train with clear goals and a bright future. The Chinese people open their hands and open their doors to welcome people from all countries, including Sri Lanka, to take advantage of China’s development to achieve common development. China welcomes to work hand in hand to jointly build a grand blueprint for the Belt and Road and jointly build a community of shared destiny among both.

BRI is seen as an opportunity in Sri Lanka and not seen as a major threat, said Professor Jayanath Colombage, Additional Secretary to the President (Foreign Relations).
 
 Indian Ocean has become the focus of attention in 21st century.Everyone; major powers, aspiring major powers, residential, outside powers are interested in the Indian Ocean.
 
 “There are a large number of strategic initiatives focusing on Indian Ocean and there are now connectivity initiatives focusing on Indian Ocean. Moreover, there are other parallel connectivity initiatives which are focusing on enhancing connectivity across the Indian Ocean.
 
 BRI and all other Chinese projects in Sri Lanka attracted a lot of attention, both positively and negatively. Many countries have been focusing their attention on Sri Lanka and it has even led to a government change in Sri Lanka in 2015. China and Chinese projects were a major campaign factor in 2015 election,” Colombage told at a seminar held under the theme, ‘Belt and Road Initiative, Challenges and Way forward,’ at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Auditorium this week.
 
 He said further the President has emphasised that Sri Lanka wishes to be a complete neutral country and maintain friendly relations with all sovereign countries in the world. Moreover, Sri Lanka don’t wish to be engaged in the major power game taking place in the India ocean.
 
 “Also, Sri Lankan foreign policy dictates that we wish to uphold Sri Lanka’s ownership on all our national strategic assets as the result of the evolving functional geography and other commitments in Sri Lanka. We need the support of all connectivity initiatives to achieve Sri Lanka’s dream of becoming a maritime hub status,” Prof. Colombage said.
 
 He added that unfortunately, Sri Lanka was engaged in branding its own assets in a negative manner.
 
 “Now we need to benefit from what is available and we’ve to make it happen for the betterment of the country. In that sense BRI is seen as an opportunity and not as a threat .Also, we feel that many BRI related projects are beneficial, at the same time we feel that giving Hambantota Port to China Merchants Port Holdings is wrong .That’s why the president was compelled to say in future, no national strategic assets will be given to the total control of another country.
 
 In economic terms, we need foreign Direct Investments, build –operate- transfer models, but the control of national assets can’t be given as long as this government will be in power.” Prof. Colombage emphasised.","['colombage', 'assets', 'opportunity', 'threat', 'indian', 'focusing', 'major', 'initiatives', 'connectivity', 'lanka', 'bri', 'sri']","{'China': 2, 'India': 6, 'Sri Lanka': 12}",,,,,

 China supported Sri Lanka’s post-war reconstruction when others ignored her needs and Chinese companies have completed more than US$15 billion infrastructure projects in the island, he told a symposium hosted by the Chinese Embassy.
 
 “As one of the first countries to openly support the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Sri Lanka is an important partner with China in the Belt and Road Initiative joint construction,” he said.
 
 Sri Lanka has a superior geographical location and a broad development prospect, he said at the seminar which was on the theme “From Millennium to the New Era: Jointly Build the Belt and Road and Embrace the Sri Lankan Dream”.
 
 The Sri Lankan dream of national progress, economic development, ethnic amity and religious harmony is consistent with the aims of BRI, Ambassador Cheng said.
 
 “In the past few years, whenever the island was hit by natural disasters, China would always provide emergency humanitarian aid such as rice, relief cash and housing for the affected,” he said.
 
 Besides, infrastructure such as roads, railways and ports have also been much improved with Chinese assistance in the last decade.
 
 “Why is China willing to help Sri Lanka?” Ambassador Cheng asked, giving three main reasons.
 
 Firstly, China and Sri Lanka have a history of friendly exchanges for over a thousand years and China gave steady support to help Sri Lanka end its terrorism threat and also stepped in during the post-war years when support from elsewhere was lacking, he said.
 
 “When standing trembling on the war ruins, Sri Lanka called for urgent support from the international community to rebuild this beautiful country, but surprisingly found that most countries choose to remain silent and watch the situation with folded arms.
 
 “At this critical moment, it was China once again that stood up with open arms for sri Lanka and participated comprehensively and deeply in the post-war reconstruction of the country.”
 
 “By end-2017, Chinese companies had completed more than US$15 billion infrastructure projects in Si Lanka in transportation, water, electricity, ports and other fields and made great contributions to the economic and social development of the country,” Ambassador Cheng said.
 
 These include the Norochcholai power station, which provides about 40% of the country’s electricity supply, the Katunayake Expressway, the Colombo International Container Terminal and the Moragahakanda reservoir, Sri Lanka’s biggest.
 
 China is also helping build section 1 of the Southern Railway and the extension of the Southern Expressway which will give a strong impetus to the development of the south.
 
 “The construction of the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota Port and Industrial Park are expected to become new, powerful engines for Sri Lanka’s economic take-off,” Ambassador Cheng said.
 
 “Our pragmatic co-operation has created more than 100,000 jobs for Sri Lanka, trained tens of thousands of technical and management personnel,” he said.
 
 Another reason for Chinese support for Sri Lanka was that both countries suffered under foreign imperialism and colonialism which enable both to empathise with each other’s fate and understand each other.
 
 “Therefore, whenever Sri Lanka is facing a major opportunity for national development, China is willing to do its utmost to help Sri Lanka,” Ambassador Cheng said.
 
 “The third reason was that the Belt and Road Initiative “combines the Chinese Dream and Sri Lankan dream together in the New Era, which makes us join hands and move forward with each other.”","['initiative', 'chinese', 'belt', 'cheng', 'key', 'development', 'lanka', 'china', 'partner', 'ambassador', 'sri', 'envoy', 'support', 'road']","{'China': 10, 'Sri Lanka': 18, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 Speaking at a gathering on Wednesday, Jim McCabe, Chief Executive Officer of Standard Chartered Bank, Sri Lanka said the Belt and Road Initiative would strengthen the country's competitiveness and improve its growth and development.
 
 Proposed by China in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aiming at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes of Silk Road.
 
 ""The Belt and Road Initiative will help Sri Lanka get the FDIs it needs. The OBOR has many positives for the island country,"" McCabe said.
 
 Wen Zha, associate professor from China Foreign Affairs University speaking at the summit, said the Belt and Road Initiative will cover more than 4 billion people and it would increase connectivity in the region.
 
 She said the initiative was open to all the countries and Sri Lanka would be an important part of the initiative due to its geographical location in the Indian Ocean region.
 
 ""Sri Lanka can link its own development plan to China's initiative in order to achieve a win-win situation,"" Wen said.
 
 However, participants also said at the summit that Sri Lanka must do more to be better involved in the initiative in order to reap benefits.
 
 ""Language is a barrier between the two and Sri Lanka must take steps to learn the Chinese language,"" Group Managing Director of Sunshine Holdings PLC Vish Govindasamy said.

 The Sri Lankan government fully supports the development of major projects such as the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota Port, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said, noting that these projects will not only help develop the country’s economy and improve people’s livelihood, but also become a major driving force for the friendly cooperation between the two countries.
 
 The prime minister said Sri Lanka welcomes more Chinese tourists as well as more Chinese investments.
 
 He also called for closer coordination and cooperation between the two countries in international affairs.
 
 For his part, Wang said China and Sri Lanka are good friends and partners who always support and help each other. China will continue to firmly support Sri Lanka in safeguarding its sovereignty and national dignity. China is willing to further consolidate political mutual trust, strengthen high-level exchanges and deepen practical cooperation between the two countries, so as to push for further promotion of their strategic cooperative partnership.
 
 The senior Chinese official called for discussion on jointly forging the China-Sri Lanka community with a shared future which features sharing opportunities and outcomes and enjoying common development and prosperity.
 
 China and Sri Lanka should speed up the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, develop the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota Port into two major engines for the fast development of the Sri Lankan economy, Wang said.
 
 Wang also called on the two sides to strengthen exchanges and cooperation in the fields of agriculture, technology, education and tourism.
 
 He said China will encourage more Chinese enterprises to invest in Sri Lanka and help the country build shipping and logistic hubs as well as industrial and financial centers in the region.
 
 China-Sri Lanka cooperation has never targeted at any third party and also it should not be affected by any third party, Wang said, stressing that deepening cooperation between China and Sri Lanka will surely be conducive to the peace and development of the region.

B. Kohona.
 
 In an interview with Daily News he said that it was pleasing to note the shift towards ICT exports and this is a step taken in the right direction. Under the new government’s series of concessions and tax incentives are offered and I think entrepreneurs should look at new products to broad base Sri Lankan export basket.”
 
 The new administration of President Gotabaya Rajapaka has a declared policy of revamping Sri Lanka’s overseas service to better meet the needs of the country. The country needs an overseas service which responds more proactively to the needs of its exporters’, tourism and investment requirements.
 
 “Diplomacy is no longer limited to maintaining and advancing international political relations. This era of gentle diplomacy is well behind us. Diplomats, who are trained and posted overseas at great expense to the country, must play a proactive role in promoting bilateral trade, investments and tourism. It is also a job for those with trained and well honed skills.”
 
 Kohona said that the government should encourage Sri Lankan diplomatic missions and trade representatives to explore new Sri Lankan products that could be exported to suit overseas markets.
 
 In other countries diplomats are provided training in promoting trade, investments and tourism, in addition to their traditional responsibilities. “Their career advancement could depend on how well they perform in all these expanded roles. Diplomats are also required to actively promote exports of goods and services.”
 
 “Sri Lanka diplomats overseas should take on this additional and proactive role and successful diplomats who bring in tangible incentives should be rewarded.”
 
 Kohona who is also the Managing Director, Hairong Investments International Pvt Ltd, Sri Lanka, emphasized that Sri Lanka can gain more from the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) if the Lankan authorities could effectively carry out the negotiations with Chinese counterparts as Sri Lanka is located in the middle of the Indian Ocean and BRI in route.
 
 He said, through BRI China would invest over US$ 6 trillion in infrastructure development mainly in Asian and African regions and Sri Lanka should carefully negotiate with China. Kohona’s company Hairong is into promoting local business and investment opportunities.
 
 China sends out 137 million tourists annually but Sri Lank, with all its advantages, receives only about a minuscule 250,000 and this should be corrected.
 
 “Even countries like Australia and France have instituted special campaigns to attract Chinese tourists, including providing language training to locals and Sri Lanka too should follow suit.” The famed department store, Galleries Lafayette of Paris, now opens on some Sundays, specifically to cater to Chinese tourists while the third Language used at the Charles de Gaulle airport is Chinese.
 
 Some of the International agreements with India, Pakistan and Singapore and others in the process of being negotiated have come under criticism, for legitimate reasons. “Some agreements require revisiting.”
 
 Negotiation of any new international agreement must have as its bottom line the protection of the national interests and not political expediency or personal benefit.
 
 China has been unreservedly supportive of Sri Lanka both during our internal terrorist inspired conflict and subsequently, as we sought to fast track our development.
 
 “The opportunities for further developing the economic relationship with China would seem to be limitless. Japan comes next followed by ASEAN and India. China, Japan, India, South Korea and Indonesia are expected to be among the top ten economies of the world by 2030.”
 
 Sri Lanka can only benefit if it proactively develops closer trade, investment and people to people relations with these booming economies. Language barriers are no longer an excuse as many bright young Sri Lankans have studied in these countries.
 
 “We also need to ensure that Sri Lanka plays responsible role in ensuring that the sea lanes caressing our shores are kept secure. Over 60% of East Asia’s energy needs float past within 20 miles of Sri Lanka. If this route is not secure, it could become a problem for East Asia.”
 
 Furthermore, Sri Lanka also needs to safeguard its own Exclusive Economic Zone and the potentially valuable continental shelf. The national claim to the continental shelf was lodged with the UN as far back as 2009. In addition, terrorism is a major threat to the region and we need to play a proactive role, along with our neighbors, to ensure international terrorism is controlled and eliminated at some point.”

 Xi made the remarks alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin while addressing a gathering in Moscow celebrating the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
 
 Solid mutual political trust is the most significant characteristic of Sino-Russian relations, of which firm mutual support is the core value, Xi said.
 
 The gathering was held after Xi and Putin signed an agreement to upgrade bilateral relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.
 
 Addressing an audience at the famous Bolshoi Theatre, Xi said that the China-Russia relationship in the new era should be built upon mutual trust and strong strategic support, and called on the two countries to have candid and in-depth communication and exchanges on major issues such as fundamental principles, policies of domestic and external affairs, and development strategies.
 
 He said the two sides should better support each other on issues concerning their respective core interests, keep a steady hand on the strategic direction of bilateral relations and say no to interference or sabotage by anyone regarding their bilateral ties.
 
 Xi pointed out that China and Russia should deepen integration of common interests and enhance connections in the new era of China-Russia relations.
 
 As both China and Russia are at critical periods of development, Xi said that the two nations should join hands to achieve prosperity together.
 
 The two countries will continue to connect the Belt and Road with the Eurasian Economic Union, promote the implementation of major strategic projects and tap the potential of cooperation in emerging areas, Xi said.
 
 Xi also highlighted the importance of strengthening people-to-people exchanges, saying that more activities in education, culture, sports, tourism, media and youth areas will be launched to bring the people’s hearts together and let the traditional friendship continue.
 
 In his speech, Xi said that China and Russia, both major countries and permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, should work together with the international community to firmly safeguard the international system with the UN at its core, and promote multipolarization of the world and democratization of international relations while building a more prosperous, stable and fair world.
 
 Earlier in the day, Xi and Putin signed two joint declarations — one to upgrade bilateral relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era and the other to strengthen global strategic stability.
 
 According to the joint statement on the strategic partnership, the China-Russian relationship has entered a new era, and is facing new opportunities for greater development.
 
 The statement said that the goal of such a new kind of partnership is for both sides to give more support to each other as they seek to take their own development paths, preserve respective core interests and protect sovereignty and territorial integrity.
 
 In his talks with Putin, Xi noted that this is his first state visit to Russia following his reelection as Chinese President last year, and is the eighth time he traveled to the country since 2013.
 
 The China-Russia relationship is seeing a continuous, steady and sound development at a high level, and is at its best in history, Xi said. Noting that the world today is becoming increasingly uncertain and unstable, Xi said enhancing the China-Russia relationship is the call of history, and a firm strategic choice by both sides.
 
 Russia and China should continue to strengthen coordination on major international and regional issues, jointly deal with the challenges of unilateralism and protectionism and maintain global peace and stability.
 
 Putin also said Russia is ready to provide China with sufficient oil and gas, and export more agricultural products to China, and he expects a faster alignment between the Eurasian Economic Union and the BRI.

 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is preparing for a fiercer tug of war with China over naubouring nations as his second term kicked off on Thursday. Whether India will strengthen its influence in the region will become clearer in countries such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, while it may distance itself further from Pakistan.
 
 Setting the tone for his regional foreign policy will be the Maldives, where Modi visits on June 7 to 8 as his first international stop.
 
 Modi will address the 87-member parliament during his stay. Cooperation between India and the Maldives will ensure “stability in the Indian Ocean region,” Mohamed Nasheed, a former president who was just selected as the Speaker, said this week.
 
 It is a calculated move, say South Asian analysts, as India and China fight for influence in an area that India regards as its backyard. They see the Maldives as a better diplomatic prize for Modi than Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom in South Asia that Modi visited first in his inaugural term.
 
 New Delhi regained a political ally in the Maldives after a presidential election late last year, when pro-Indian President Ibrahim Solih defeated the pro-China -- and openly anti-Indian -- incumbent Abdulla Yameen.
 
 By then, China had made inroads into the Maldives and India’s other South Asian neighbours, ranging from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to Nepal, through its Belt and Road Initiative. India has struggled to match this multimillion-dollar network of infrastructure projects funded by Chinese loans.
 
 Analysts expect Modi’s foreign policies to be tested in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, both of which have governments with close ties to New Delhi, despite some sticking points.
 
 While bilateral ties between India and Bangladesh have strengthened during Modi’s first term, Dhaka is still waiting to resolve a long-standing dispute about sharing water of the Teesta River, which flows along the India-Bangladesh border.
 
 As for Sri Lanka, fishing trawlers from India’s southern state of Tamil Nadu regularly enter Sri Lankan waters in the Indian Ocean, creating diplomatic spats.
 
 “These countries will be looking to Prime Minister Modi to deliver on outstanding bilateral issues, such as finally signing the Teesta River accord with Bangladesh and resolving fishing disputes with Sri Lanka,” said Nilanthi Samaranayake, director for strategy and policy analysis at the Center for Naval Analyses, a Washington D.C.-based think tank.
 
 Nepal also poses a diplomatic challenge. Indian interference in the landlocked-country’s politics resulted in an anti-Indian wave during the December 2017 general elections. A more pro-China left alliance now governs in Kathmandu.

 India, which skipped the high-profile meeting, would have joined “very happily” in the One Belt and One Road (OBOR) initiative of China, said Sarath Amanugama, Sri Lanka’s Minister on Special Assignment.
 
 “Unfortunately, the issue is going through the heart of Indian interests. If it is some uncontested region, India would have negotiated its way out. Here especially the Kashmir issue getting dragged into it, makes it difficult for India to be flexible,” Amanugama, who accompanied Lankan Prime Minister Wickramasinghe to the two-day forum here, told PTI.
 
 He said India, China and Sri Lanka were very much part of the ancient Silk Road route as the Chinese Buddhist scholars like Faxian visited both India and Sri Lanka leading to big discoveries of Buddhist relics in the island nation.
 
 “(Chinese) President Xi Jinping has emphasised connectivity. These countries were connected many centuries ago. This will link up these countries on certain rational basis. Once the regional problems are resolved, then India has to play big role in the initiative,” he said, adding that India anyway has to play big role “because you cannot think of a belt and road without going over and close to India.”
 
 India skipped the meeting due to its sovereignty concerns over the USD 50 billion CPEC, which goes through Pakistan- occupied Kashmir. The two-day conference in Beijing brought together leaders from 29 countries.
 
 Besides Wickramasinghe, the summit was attended by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and several other leaders, heads of UN, World Bank and IMF.
 
 Wickaramasinghe, who arrived here a day after he hosted Prime Minister Narandra Modi in Sri Lanka, had a low-key presence at the high-profile summit.
 
 While Sharif and many other leaders spoke at the inaugural ceremony, the Sri Lankan leader reportedly took part in the discussions in the round table meeting yesterday.
 
 Amunagama said that Sri Lanka will not permit any foreign military operations in its port by any country including China, in an effort to reassure India’s security concerns over Chinese military activity.

 Tham said the Port City, which is the single largest FDI project in Sri Lanka, is to transform the future of condominium living in Sri Lanka to a great extent. “As the country progresses, this project will have a significant social economic impact on Sri Lanka. And our vision is to create a world class city for the South Asian region and it is going to be a game changer for this country as well as for the entire region,” Tham told a seminar on ‘Future of Condominium Living in Sri Lanka’, organized by the Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka in Colombo last week.
 
 Speaking further he said, the Port City Project is transforming the physical and economic landscape in the country in a big way. Sri Lanka is in a strategic position on maritime silk route and the Port City is an investment that comes under Chinese government’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
 
 “The Port City offers an ideal platform not only for Sri Lankans, also for the international community to benefit from the global market transformation significantly,” Tham said.
 
 He further said it is important to constantly reinvent their services in order to effectively compete in a changing global market place.","['city', 'market', 'transform', 'port', 'region', 'colombo', 'condominium', 'country', 'lanka', 'tham', 'sri', 'living', 'project']",{'Sri Lanka': 7},,,,,

 The new unit, called Fuel Oil Sri Lanka Co Ltd, has been registered in Hambantota on the southern tip of the country, according to a report on the website of Sinopec Group, parent of Sinopec Corp.
 
 
 
 Fuel oil is a refined product mostly used as bunker fuel for ships and is also burned in power stations.
 
 
 
 The move marks the latest investment in Sri Lanka by China, which sees the South Asian island nation as a pivotal part of its Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure plan.
 
 
 
 Sinopec stressed the strategic location of Hambantota port on the Indian Ocean along a key shipping route between the Suez Canal and the Malacca Strait, which is transited by two-thirds of global oil shipments. The market to supply fuel to ships had “huge” potential, it said.
 
 
 
 In March, India’s Accord Group and Oman’s Ministry of Oil and Gas signed a $3.85 billion deal to build a 200,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery near Hambantota port, in the biggest single pledge of foreign direct investment ever made in Sri Lanka.

 Q: How do you hope to take India-Sri Lanka ties to a “higher level”, as you said here in New Delhi, and what are the priority areas?
 
 A: Even during (former President) Mahinda Rajapaksa’s time we had very close relations with New Delhi, and then at the end (2014-15), it suddenly went down. And even if with the Sirisena government, they started with a very good relationship, but it ended with a lot of frustration. I would like to be consistent. I am usually very frank, so I hope to tell New Delhi honestly if I can’t do something; and if I can, then do it soon and not drag out commitments. We were successful during the previous government because we had a separate mechanism, the Troika (a 3-man coordination team) with New Delhi. We needed that mechanism because the conflict was on, and we were able to solve sensitive problems because of the close links.
 
 Q: Will you bring in the same mechanism for coordination again?
 
 A: Well, at that time there was a necessity because of the conflict, but now I don’t think it is necessary, as we can work through the foreign ministries. If we are upfront and work genuinely, we will not have issues. I think the main issues India could have with us would be on (our relations) with China or Pakistan, but if we don’t do anything that creates suspicions amongst Indian authorities, there will not be any problem.
 
 Q: On development cooperation with Delhi, for which PM Modi announced an additional $400 million, will you honour the MoU signed by former PM Ranil Wickremesinghe on projects like the Trincomalee oil farms and Port development projects?
 
 A: There are certain projects where we have to change certain modalities, and we discussed it during this visit. I haven’t studied all the projects in detail yet, but I will promise that we will expedite all the projects that are important to Sri Lanka.
 
 Q: You have said publicly you will renegotiate the Hambantota port agreement with China, which India was concerned about. Along with that is the future of Mattala airport, which India has shown an interest in. Now that you are in power, what will you do?
 
 A: I believe that the Sri Lankan Government must have control of all strategically important projects like Hambantota. After all, these are not like a hotel or a terminal, but to give control of a port or an airport or our harbours is different.
 
 With our control, they can do anything, but these 99-year lease agreements (that the previous government signed) will have an impact on our future. The next generation will curse our generation for giving away precious assets otherwise.
 
 That is why our party protested these decisions.
 
 Q: But the reason the lease had to be given was because of the debts incurred by the government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa…
 
 A: No, that is wrong. It is also wrong to say there was a debt trap. In fact, during our time the ports authority paid back the first instalment (to Chinese banks). The Sirisena government, on the other hand, got more money as loans and just spent it. If they were worried about the debts piling up why didn’t they first service the debt, rather than give away sovereignty?
 
 Q: India has also had issues with Sri Lanka’s defence cooperation with China in the past, especially over the docking of Chinese submarines, when you were Defence Secretary. In 2017, you said, India had a “bee in its bonnet” on the issue. Will you be more sensitive to those concerns this time around as President?
 
 A: We were sensitive then too, but the submarine issue was a simple issue overlooked by officials at the time. Warships were visiting Sri Lanka regularly, and all ships that were part of the naval piracy task force for the Arabian Sea, including Russian ships had docked there. When the Chinese asked for the submarines to be docked, officials considered it a normal port call and approved it. Former NSA Shiv Shankar Menon has written in his book that “Gotabaya gave his word that he would not do anything counter to India, and he kept his word”, so I was genuinely sensitive.
 
 Q: You mentioned India’s suspicions of the past, those include differences over China, and the Tamil issue, but also your allegation that Indian agencies conspired for regime change against your brother. Can your government turn the page on these past suspicions?
 
 A: I am sure (we can turn the page). We did hear about agencies conspiring, including the US, for regime change. Some of their suspicions were due to our ties with China, but that was a misunderstanding. We had a purely commercial agreement with China. I want to tell India, Japan, Singapore and Australia and other countries also to come and invest in us. They should tell their companies to invest in Sri Lanka and help us grow, because if they do not, then not only Sri Lanka, but countries all over Asia will have the same (problem). The Chinese will take the Belt and Road Initiative all over unless other countries provide an alternative.
 
 Q: What kind of cooperation on terrorism do you foresee now with India?
 
 A: The threat in Sri Lanka has now changed: unlike the LTTE which was a specific threat to Sri Lanka, IS (Islamic State) is a global threat posed by terrorists across the world. India and other countries have more information on this threat than us. The previous government didn’t give much priority to security and intelligence issues. During our time, military intelligence was always the most important organisation, but the last government took their (oversight) away from the military. We have now reversed that. We also hope to upgrade our intelligence as it was earlier geared towards only LTTE threats, not the IS, and we need help from India and others on this as well as on technological cooperation.
 
 Q: Your focus on national security also raises fears about human rights violations of the past, about disappearances and the “White Vans”, as well as worries about violence against journalists in particular. Will you give assurances that those will not return?
 
 A: Those are bogus allegations, and certainly, nothing of the sort was done by me. Post-2009, we had tried to study the allegations, but it is difficult. We were not responsible, and even though we did ask the CID (Criminal Investigation Department) to investigate the charges, but they didn’t have any evidence. If it was easy, why didn’t the (Sirisena) government pursue these charges? The fact is we were strict about journalists during the war, but not in peacetime. Remember, MR’s government didn’t start the war, we finished the war. Why aren’t previous presidents being asked about these allegations?
 
 Q: Last week, after Dr. Jaishankar’s visit to Colombo, the Indian government issued a statement urging justice and equality for Tamils. What is your reaction?
 
 A: My approach, as I told the Foreign Minister, is that it is more important to give the (Tamils) development, and better living. In terms of freedoms, and political rights there are already provisions in the constitution. But I am clear that we have to find ways to directly benefit people there through jobs, and promoting fisheries and agriculture. We can discuss political issues, but for 70 odd years, successive leaders have promised one single thing: devolution, devolution, devolution. But ultimately nothing happened. I also believe that you can’t do anything against the wishes and feeling of the majority community. Anyone who is promising something against the majority’s will is untrue. No Sinhala will say, don’t develop the area, or don’t give jobs, but political issues are different. I would say, judge me by my record on development (of North and East) after five years.
 
 Q: Are you promising talks on devolution or the 13th amendment on rights for the Tamil majority areas?
 
 A: Look, the 13th amendment is part of the constitution and is functional, except for some areas like control of police powers, which we can’t implement. I am willing to discuss alternatives to that.
 
 Q: In the past as defence secretary, you led Sri Lankan forces to victory, but amidst allegations of human rights abuse, and you were accused of declining to take forward the internationally-mandated truth and reconciliation process. What would you like your legacy to be at the end of five years?
 
 A: Those allegations are wrong. In peacetimes, my engagement was even more than during the war to try and work on these issues. I did demining, I worked on resettlement and rehabilitation and development, and I got all militia to disarm. Without me, there would not have been provincial council elections, which our government conducted for the first time in the North and the East. We ensured the elections were free and fair; we didn’t try to manipulate them or bring in a candidate of our choice. The international community did not recognise these things, even the Tamil politicians did not recognise these things which led to a (better situation in the North and East).
 
 Q: Your elder brother Mahinda is now Prime Minister, while another brother Chamal is a minister. How will the relationship with your brothers work now, and will there be a transfer of power towards a more parliamentary system as under the 19th amendment?
 
 A: The 19th amendment (passed in 2015) is a failure and if we get 2/3rds majority in parliament we will drop it from the constitution. The only way you can even make the 19th amendment work is with two brothers (laughs) [at the top]. For a country to be governed successfully, you need stability. This was not the case during the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government, where they were fighting all the time and there was no development. Without stability, investors won’t come.
 
 Q: Is it true you are called the Terminator in the family?
 
 A: (Laughs) That is not true. I am the most innocent person in our family, since my childhood. When I joined the army, my family said Mahinda should have joined the army, and I should have joined politics.","['projects', 'development', 'failure', 'amendment', 'sri', 'president', '19th', 'lanka', 'didnt', 'india', 'china', 'rajapaksa', 'work', 'past', 'issues']","{'Australia': 1, 'China': 6, 'India': 16, 'Japan': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 10, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Singapore': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

In other words, the country plans to use its strategic location and leverage on our connectivity to become the Hub of the Indian Ocean.
 
 In order to achieve this objective, the required infrastructure should be in place and one of the vital components is the internal connectivity. Restoration of the transport links by rail, road and waterways would involve minimal investments and would result in maximum benefits in the shortest time-frame.
 
 Kottawa-Makumbura Multi-Modal Transport Hub
 
 Emphasizing this prime need, President Maithripala Sirisena says that our country needs to take many steps in strengthening the road and rail transport services with new technology. Speaking at the ceremony to vest the Kottawa-Makumbura Multi-Modal Transport Hub, constructed according to the international standard, with the public, he said, that for a country vying to attract foreign investments for rapid growth, needs an efficient reliable rail and road connectivity together with other pre-required infrastructure.
 
 The Multi-modal Transport Center built under the guidance of Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development will provide the public and the business community an opportunity to avail services of bus, train and taxi at one place for passenger travel and goods freight respectively. Passengers or goods taken by roadways can be interchanged to a railway lines at the centre.
 
 The Multi-modal Transport Center comprised of LED Panels to apprise the public, passengers are informed on the locations of busses and trains at any given time through GPS technology, the online booking of tickets, travel in trains and buses can be made by a single ticket, the availability of self-ticket facilities, restaurants and sanitary facilities, banking facilities, bill payment centres. It is significant that all the energy requirements of the centre are achieved utilizing solar power. This Centre will follow a formal maintenance and management process.
 
 Marking another important phase of rail connectivity, the newly constructed Matara - Beliatta railway extension on Southern coastal line was opened last week. The 113-kilometre railway line from Matara to Kataragama is to be completed in three phases and the Matara to Beliatta segment is the first phase of the project.
 
 Construction of the Matara to Beliatta section was carried out at a cost of US$ 278 million by a Chinese company with the funding from China Exim Bank. Supervision was done, under the guidance of the Central Engineering Bureau. The second phase of the project is the 48-kilometre segment from Beliatta to Hambantota and in the third phase, the track will be extended to another 39 kilometres covering Hambantota and Kataragama.
 
 These internal infrastructure developments are of extreme importance for Sri Lanka to reach a hub position taking advantage of an island-nation geopolitically positioned at an important inter section in the Indian Ocean.
 
 The Indian Ocean is being increasingly defined as the ocean of the future. The linkages between the Indian and Pacific oceans are envisaged to create a maritime superhighway that can bring prosperity to all. The Indian Ocean has become another area of global geopolitics. Nevertheless, what others see as competitiveness, the host countries such as Sri Lanka could see as complementary.
 
 Several of these advanced infrastructure projects, including the Hambantota Port and the Mattala airport in the South and the Southern expressway have been carried out for this purpose. Furthermore, the development of the three major ports and the two international airports which are all connected by road and rail to the proposed special Economic Zones.
 
 Economic and social development
 
 Sri Lanka is confident that these initiatives will transform it into a shipping, aviation and a logistics hub. At the same time, Sri Lanka proposes to strengthen financial connectivity by establishing an offshore financial centre in the Colombo Port City, which is a Real Estate Development project commenced under the Belt and Road Initiative of China.
 
 The Belt and Road initiative will provide the much needed connectivity in the Indian Ocean required for rapid economic and social development.
 
 One drawback one could see is that India is not very enthusiastic over China’s Belt and Road plans. India also skipped the Belt & Road Forum following sovereignty concerns over the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The Belt and Road initiative is the first economic cooperation arrangement connecting the Eurasian continents.
 
 Combining the high-income economies with the fast growing economies the initiative will create new opportunities for the growth of global trade.
 
 Sri Lanka’s Vision 2025 is founded on a set of core principles including a strategy for national exports, social market economy and a skill pool to match the demands of the job market. Vision 2025 has fixed targets of achieving an annual export income of $ 20 billion, increase Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) up to $ 5 billion and to create employment opportunities for at least a million Sri Lankans by 2025.
 
 Today, India’s vision is primarily focused on increasing connectivity within its own borders. When the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) was set up 34 years ago, the region had high expectations that rivalries such as India and Pakistan would set aside political differences and would strengthen economic, social and cultural and development cooperation in South Asia. However, now we find chances of reviving SAARC is rather dim. Despite that India gave us hopes of close cooperation through two other initiatives – BIMSTEC and IORA.
 
 The countries in the region are well aware of the fact the need for peace and stability in the Indian Ocean region. In fact when Indian Defence Secretary Sanjay Mitra called on President Sirisena in Colombo, both emphasized the importance of regional security. This region has enormous economic potential and is the lifeline of global trade. In order to uphold order, a mechanism for cooperation needs to be explored.
 
 Sri Lanka strongly believes that there is a need for the Indian Ocean to explore ways to augment cooperation across the maritime domain, such regionalism should strive to create closer linkages between ASEAN, IORA and BIMSTEC. The preference is for a rules-based order in the Indian Ocean that benefits all.
 
 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched his ‘Act East’ policy with the aim to strengthen links between India and member countries of Association of South East Asian Nations, giving India’s landlocked northeast region better access to its southern ports and establishing new land corridors connecting India to Thailand through Mynamar.
 
 Belt and Road Initiative
 
 Connectivity of China with South Asia under the Belt and Road Initiative can only make a better Asia. It is not just about connectivity of roads or seas but connectivity of economies which can improve the lives of people of the whole region of South Asia.
 
 Distance does matter, more so in the context of looming depletion of fossil fuels. Rising freight charges will give a fillip to the trend towards making products closer to the market. Regional rather than global production networks are likely to become more important in future. Availability and access to relevant technologies in the neighbouring countries would be cost-effective in the long run and would also bring about harmonization of transport technologies.
 
 Restoration of the transport links by rail, road and waterways would involve minimal investments and would result in maximum benefits in the shortest time-frame.
 
 With regard to direct connectivity to India, it is necessary to reintroduce the suspended ferry services between Sri Lanka and India.
 
 Transport projects are an essential component under various regional groupings (SAARC, BIMSTEC, Mekong-Ganga Cooperation). Need for their integration. Bilateral or sub-regional initiatives would be instrumental in providing the necessary connectivity.","['indian', 'ocean', 'cooperation', 'connectivity', 'prosperity', 'transport', 'lanka', 'india', 'sri', 'achieving', 'road', 'south']","{'China': 5, 'India': 22, 'Sri Lanka': 9, 'Pakistan': 2, 'Thailand': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 “Sri Lanka is in urgent need of a high-end platform to attract financial institutions, multinational companies, shoppers, tourists as well as provide jobs for well-educated locals as a part of its post-war reconstruction. The Port City project is planned in the best interests of Sri Lanka,” said Sun Ziyu, vice president of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC).
 
 With an initial investment of US$1.4 billion, Colombo Port City is China’s biggest project in Sri Lanka, a key node along the Maritime Silk Road of the Belt and Road plan.
 
 Sun said the development within Sri Lanka’s biggest commercial city, which will be built on 269 hectares of reclaimed land, would accommodate 200,000 residents and consists of apartments, hotels, offices, shopping malls, exhibition centres, as well as provide 80,000 new jobs. It is expected to be completed by 2030.
 
 Sun said the reclamation work had helped transform the area’s coastline which was previously hit by strong winds blowing towards the Indian Ocean that made it less liveable.
 
 “[This has] also improved coastal protection, and is a boon to the environment,” he said.
 
 China’s “Belt and Road” plan comprises a belt of overland corridors and sea routes connecting Asia, Africa and Europe through building infrastructure and boosting financial and trade ties for over 60 countries that lie along the routes.
 
 Belt and Road projects offer huge opportunities, but also present sources of risk for Chinese banks.
 
 In 2016 alone, Chinese firms signed new construction projects worth a total contractual value of US$126 billion. CCCC accounted for one-tenth, or US$12.6 billion of the projects.
 
 It has participated in more than 300 Belt and Road projects across 58 countries. Key projects include the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, Zemun-Borca Bridge in Serbia and the North-South Highway in Jamaica, with value totaling US$47 billion.
 
 Even with numerous years of overseas experience behind them, Sun said each investment decision was made on repeated verification on multiple fronts of the prospects – from local culture, regulatory policies to environmental issues, as well as soliciting advice from world-class experts. The most important measurement is, the project must benefit local society, he said.
 
 “Making profit is important, but if you only consider making money, you will finally lose it. Benefiting others, you will benefit at the end,” Sun stressed.

 In Kenya, the company has helped build its first new railway in over 100 years that will begin operations next month. The 480-kilometre track, which replaces the abandoned British-built track, connects the capital Nairobi with East Africa’s largest port of Mombasa. The US$4 billion construction is also the biggest infrastructure project in Kenya since its independence in 1963.
 
 Sun said the Belt and Road was an open-ended platform and the Chinese way is not the only standard.
 
 Take the railway project. The company was unable to lay the standard Chinese tracks on the black cotton soil in Africa, but had to make adjustments to accommodate local conditions.
 
 To date, CCCC has expanded its footprint in over 140 countries and regions, with major overseas business in Africa, South-east Asia, Oceania, Middle East and Eurasia.
 
 In 2016, new contracts for overseas infrastructure construction signed amounted to 205.9 billion yuan (US$29.8 billion), a 51 per cent increase over the previous year. It has also ventured into Italy and Canada for the first time in 2016, and looks to expand in Europe next, as well as the US.

 “It is understandable that the cooperation has left some Asian countries vigilant as media reports suggest that an 80 per cent share of the port, which sits on an important trade route, and land for an industrial zone will be leased to China for the next 99 years,” an article in Global Times referring to Sri Lanka’s decision to hand over the Hambatota Port to China.
 
 Also there was public agitation over the land given to China to industrial zone in Hambatota.
 
 “However, joining the project would be better than standing aside and being jealous,” the article said.
 
 “As more and more South Asian countries keep a positive attitude toward China’s efforts to improve infrastructure in the region, skeptics in countries such as India should rethink their stance toward the Chinese-funded project in Sri Lanka,” it said.
 
 “China is likely to adopt an open attitude if other countries can put aside the idea of geopolitical confrontation and join in on harbour construction of the island nation,” it said.
 
 Referring to concerns in India and Japan over Chinese investments totalling over USD 8 billion, the article said, “the Chinese-funded project in Sri Lanka is not a nail being knocked into the geopolitical landscape of South Asia to curb India’s rise”.
 
 China’s economic cooperation with Sri Lanka does not target any third party, including India and Japan, because the project is just another move in pushing forward the Belt and Road initiative, an open, inclusive international cooperative proposal that any nation is welcome to take part in, it said.
 
 India and Japan should feel free to join the initiative in a bid to boost their presence in Sri Lanka’s economy, but it is questionable whether the two countries are willing to spend a large amount of money on supporting the economy of Sri Lanka and pushing forward regional economic integration, it said.
 
 “If Sri Lanka could not get enough financial support from India and Japan to build its port facilities, it seems inadvisable to prevent the South Asian country from seeking help from China, a country that is witnessing a boom in outbound investment,” it said.
 
 “Some countries like India and Bangladesh will be the first batch of beneficiaries of China’s efforts to build a network of roads and infrastructure facilities in South Asia to open up new trade routes. In this regard, China’s economic cooperation with Sri Lanka will contribute not just to the local economy but to the whole region,” it said.

 This pictorial from the pages of the book, depicts a few of those moments of this six-decade-long friendship.
 
 In the introduction, Sri Lankan Ambassador to China, Dr. Karunasena Kodituwakku, who with the Embassy staff decided to publish the commemorative volume, points out that Sri Lanka was the first South Asian country to accept the ‘One China Policy’ in 1950 and in 1952 came forward to sign the historical Rubber-Rice Agreement with China during a critical time where the former was facing a UN embargo. “This was the first trade agreement that was signed by China with a non-Communist country, and it has been renewed over 30 years, making it perhaps one of the longest effective trade agreements between any two countries.”
 
 In the 21st century, the relationship between the two countries is of critical importance, as Dr. Kodituwakku noted, considering Sri Lanka’s key position in China’s One Belt One Road initiative.

In the past 92 years, from war to peace, PLA had gone through arduous struggles to epic accomplishments of national independence, people’s liberation and peaceful development. Chinese people and PLA are peace-loving. China will continue to develop itself by securing a peaceful international environment and, at the same time, uphold and promote world peace through its own development.
 
 China never seek hegemony, expansion or spheres of influence. China pursues a national defense policy that is defensive in nature. Since the foundation of People’s Republic of China (PRC), border conflicts that were obliged to happen with individual neighbouring countries are defensive counterattack when the Chinese territory, sovereignty, maritime rights and interests, people’s life and properties were severely infringed even though all the peaceful measures have been adopted.
 
 China has been always upholding the principle of settling international disputes and hotspot issues by peaceful manners. China advocates “One Belt One Road” through engaging in international collaboration, achieving shared benefits and win-win situation, which signifies China will never follow the old path of rising of Big Powers by establishing colonial system, contesting sphere of influence. The growing military strength of China is the powerful positive energy to safeguard world peace and boost the common development rather than the tool for expansionism. The important thought to “Build a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind” has been written into the Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party and the Constitution of PRC, further respected and accepted by United Nations. It once again declares to worldwide that Chinese military development does not pose a threat to any country. No matter what stage of development it reaches, China will never seek expansion or spheres of influence. For considerable time of period, Chinese expenditure for national defense is approximately 1.3% of GDP, which is the lowest among the permanent members of UN Security Council, far below 2.3% -2.5% of the world average percentage and over 3% of several military superpowers such as USA and Russia. Since 1978, the disarmament has involved more than 4 million military personnel.
 
 Chinese military strategy
 
 Chinese military is open and transparent. The Chinese military has published the white paper ‘China’s Military Strategy’ for several times, which clearly illustrated the trends of Chinese military strategy. Through organising Xiangshan Forum, the Chinese military provided equal dialogue platform for militaries from other countries to discuss global security issues. The Chinese military introduced herself to the World in a timely manner by building “National Defense Release” Wechat and Microblog platforms. The Chinese military has continuously presented the open and transparent sincerity and attitude to the world by various measures.
 
 China has established military ties with more than 150 countries and has put in place 54 defense consultation and dialogue mechanisms with 41countries and international organisations. Chinese and Russian military ties have continued to operate at a high level. China and USA maintain overall stability in military ties. Chinese military has strived to make the military ties of both sides a stabilizer of bilateral ties based on the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. Focusing on building a community with a shared future for mankind, China has established defense and security consultation mechanism with 17 neighbouring countries and their strategic mutual trust has been continuously strengthened. In 2018, the Chinese military has participated in about 40 joint exercises with more than 30 countries, and strengthened the friendship and mutual trust with foreign militaries.
 
 Chinese military is actively providing more and more international public safety products. Chinese military is actively promoting the international and regional security cooperation, participating the problem solving of significant international security and tackling the challenges to security. PLA has made significant contribution in the operations of peacekeeping and humanitarianism as well. Since 1990, Chinese military has been participating in 24 UN peacekeeping operations, dispatched more than 39,000 peacekeeping military personnel, 13 of them died in the frontline of the operation. Atul Khare, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, spoke highly of China’s important role in the peacekeeping operations, noting China is the Permanent Member of UN Security Council, one of the largest contributors of troops and the second largest financial contributor to peacekeeping budget.
 
 China is the only country undertaking the three glorious missions. Since December 2008, the Chinese military has dispatched naval taskforces to the Gulf of Aden and the Somali waters to carry out regular escort operations, providing safety protection for more than 6,600 Chinese and foreign ships in 10 years. Chinese PLA Navy’s hospital ship Peace Ark (Hull 866) has visited 43 countries, and provided free medical service to more than 230,000 people, since its commission to the PLA Navy a decade ago.
 
 Easter Sunday attacks
 
 Recently, the state council of the People’s Republic of China published the white paper China’s National Defense in New Era, in which China again solemnly declare her commitment to peaceful development and work with people of all countries to safeguard world peace and promote common development.
 
 China is fully supporting the developing countries to strengthen the security including Sri Lanka. In December, 2018, the China-aided office and auditorium complex was handed over to the Sri Lanka Military Academy. On July 8, 2019, The China-gifted frigate “P625” to the Sri Lanka Navy arrived in Colombo Port.
 
 After the Sri Lanka Easter Sunday attacks on April 21, China provided emergency anti-terrorism training for more than 20 senior officials, donated a large number of security equipment and police vehicles. Furthermore, China will continue to provide various training for Sri Lanka military and police, aid more security equipment at Sri Lanka’s request. It should be noted that China’s aid has no any political condition, no interfering the internal affairs of the recipient country, only aims to improve the ability of security in recipient country, realize the peace in the countries and world peace.","['countries', 'military', 'peace', 'chinese', 'international', 'force', 'china', 'sri', 'security', 'world', 'defense']","{'China': 25, 'Sri Lanka': 6, 'Mali': 1, 'United States': 4}",,,,,

 “Yes, though feasibility studies said the port wouldn’t work. Yes, though other frequent lenders like India had refused. Yes, though Sri Lanka’s debt was ballooning rapidly under Mr. Rajapaksa,” the paper asserted.
 
 Are the allegations true and fair?
 
 The Sri Lankan government has long wanted to build a seaport in Hambantota. Two feasibility studies were conducted before the Sri Lankan government embarked on the ambitious Hambantota port project.
 
 The first feasibility study was completed in 2003 by a Canadian engineering firm, SNC-Lavalin. However, it was rejected by the ministerial task force on the grounds that it was not bankable and was incomplete since the study overlooked the port’s potential impact on Colombo Port. Three years later, Ramboll, a Danish consulting firm undertook a second feasibility study and adopted a more optimistic view of the potential of Hambantota Port. It projected that dry and bulk cargo would constitute the main traffic for the port until 2030. Hambantota Port was expected to handle approximately 20 million twenty-foot equivalent units by 2040.
 
 Tsunami devastates Hambantota
 
 On December 26, 2004, a magnitude 9.1 earthquake with its epicenter off the west coast of Indonesia’s Sumatra island triggered a series of deadly tsunamis across the Indian Ocean, killing an estimated 230,000 people in 14 countries.
 
 Sri Lanka was the second hardest hit. The strong waves wiped out entire villages and townships in the south and east coast of the island nation, caused 30,000 reported deaths, damaged highways and railways, destroyed schools and hospitals and left 900,000 people homeless. Hambantota, a bustling southeastern coastal town known for its salt production, was completely devastated.
 
 Hambantota Port project not initiated by China
 
 Hambantota is home to Mahinda Rajapaksa, the sixth president of Sri Lanka, and his electoral district. When coming to power in November 2005, he wasted no time in launching several big-ticket infrastructure projects to revitalize the economy of his hometown. Hambantota Port, a project first mooted by his father, was one of them.
 
 In a brief published in April 2018, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, an influential U.S. think tank, affirmed that Hambantota Port was not a China-initiated project. In fact, Hambantota Port was constructed long before the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was launched in 2013.
 
 China’s loan to finance development of Hambantota Port
 
 India was the first country Rajapaksa turned to for financial help to build Hambantota Port. However, his request was rejected as India deemed the project economically unviable. The multilateral development banks, or MDBs, were also unwilling to lend their support to the project.
 
 China saw the potential of Hambantota Port, which strategically lies a mere 10 nautical miles north of the busy Indian Ocean international shipping route. It not only meets the logistical needs of China’s burgeoning global trade, but also serves as a transshipment hub and a supply base providing bunkering facilities to the large number of vessels plying one of the busiest shipping routes in the world. India’s relaxation of its cabotage rules in May greatly enhanced Hambantota’s status as the transshipment port for goods destined for the subcontinent. Exim Bank of China eventually agreed to fund 85 percent of Hambantota Port’s Phase 1 construction costs after much negotiations. The 15-year commercial loan of $306 million carried an interest rate of 6.3 percent with a four-year moratorium.
 
 “The Sri Lankan team did try to seek a preferential loan from China, but the quota of China’s preferential loans then to Sri Lanka had been used for the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant and other projects,” China explained in a Xinhua News Agency report in 2015. Sri Lanka was given two options for the interest rate: A 6.3 percent fixed rate or a floating rate pegged to the London Interbank Offered Rate, which was over 5 percent then and trending higher. In October 2007, Sri Lanka issued a Fitch BB-rated, 5-year sovereign bond at 8.25 percent, not a surprising move for the island nation that was still mired in a prolonged civil conflict with the Tamil Tigers. Exim Bank of China later provided additional loans totaling $900 million to finance Phase 2 of the Hambantota Port project at 2 percent, a preferential rate enjoyed by 77 percent of Chinese loans to Sri Lanka.
 
 Hambantota Port suffered losses after opening
 
 Construction work for Phase 1 of Hambantota Port, undertaken jointly by China Harbour Engineering Company (CMPH) and Sinohydro Corporation, commenced in January 2008. The port became operational on November 18, 2010, five months ahead of schedule. However, Hambantota Port was unable to generate sufficient revenue to meet its loan obligations due to inadequate governance, lack of commercial and industrial activities, as well as its inability to attract passerby vessels to dock at the port. By the end of 2016, it suffered a total loss of $304 million.
 
 Majority control of Hambantota Port goes to CMPH
 
 Amid mounting pressure to meet the International Monetary Fund’s bailout terms and loan repayment obligations, the Sri Lankan government struck a public-private partnership (PPP) deal with China in July 2017, giving majority control of Hambantota Port to CMPH, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE).
 
 According to the filing made by CMPH to the HKSE, the terms of the concession agreement related to Hambantota Port were as follows:
 
 CMPH would make an investment of $1.12 billion in Sri Lanka, out of which $974 million would be used for the acquisition of 85 percent shares in the Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG), a company which was granted a 99-year term by the Sri Lankan government to develop, manage and operate Hambantota Port valued at $1.4 billion. HIPG would acquire 58 percent of Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), which had been given the exclusive rights to develop, manage and operate the Common User Facility of Hambantota Port. The Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) would hold 15 percent and 42 percent equity interest in HIPG and HIPS, respectively. The remaining $146 million would be deposited in CMPH’s Sri Lanka bank account for the purpose of future development of the port and marine-related activities.
 
 Within 10 years from the effective date of the concession agreement, SLPA has the right to buy back 20 percent shares of HIPG on terms mutually agreed upon. After 70 years, SLPA could acquire CMPH’s entire shareholdings in HIPG at a fair value to be determined by the valuers appointed by both parties. On expiry of 80 years, SLPA could buy up CMPH’s shareholdings in HIPG for $1, leaving CMPH with 40 percent shareholdings in HIPH. After 99 years, CMPH would transfer all its shareholdings in HIPG and HIPS to the Sri Lanka government and SLPA at a token price of $1 upon termination of the agreement. The concession agreement went into effect on December 9, 2017. To increase industrial and commercial activities at the port, China further undertook to develop a 50 sq. km economic zone and build a liquefied natural gas plant and a tourist dockyard. China will also invest between $400 million to $600 million to develop phase 3 of Hambantota Port which is expected to be completed by 2021. The PPP thus is not a debt-equity swap but a fresh investment by CMPH amounting to $1.12 billion. The loan taken by SLPA for the construction of Hambantota Port was transferred to Sri Lanka’s treasury. CMPH’s investment in HIPG will be disbursed in three tranches of $292 million, $97 million and $584 million, with the balance of $146 million to be deposited in CMPH’s Sri Lanka bank account for future use.
 
 Hambantota Port: A lesson China learned
 
 Sri Lanka had a dream; its government had a vision: To turn strategically-located Hambantota into one of the busiest ports in the world.
 
 When its neighbour turned its back, when the MDBs were cold to the project, China provided the funding and built Hambantota Port with good intentions. However, as the dream went sour, China got the blame. The storyline was twisted. Hambantota became the oft-cited case of “debt trap” under the BRI. China was accused of twisting Sri Lanka’s arm “to cough up a port.” Hambantota is a lesson China should learn: BRI projects must be transparent. World perception is as important as the intention. According to a recent report by the Financial Times, “China’s development banks—the biggest lenders in the sector worldwide—are ramping up co-operation with overseas financial institutions after problems with international investment projects.”
 
 China’s Development Bank is now “considering combining its lending efforts with western financial institutions that require adherence to ‘international standards’—including open, competitive tenders for project contracts as well as public studies on environmental and social impacts,” the paper highlighted.
 
 Perhaps China has learnt a lesson from Hambantota Port.

 Many monks, scholars, and Buddhist lay people believe that Sri Lanka is the world’s cradle of Theravada Buddhism, as shown by the Mahavamsa, the text written by Buddhist monks that stretches back two millennia.
 
 But Professor Osmund Bopearachchi, a University of Kelaniya graduate who is now a professor of Central and South Asian Art and Archeology at the University of California Berkeley, argues that the story is actually much more complex.
 
 
 
 Sri Lanka Ports Authority Logistics Director Upali de Zoysa.
 
 At a recent lecture at the University of Colombo, Professor Bopearachchi said the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka is more influenced by Mahayana forms and ideas, particularly from South India, than people think.
 
 “The time has come for Buddhist scholars, archeologists, and art historians to examine closely the diffusion of (Mahayana) Buddhism from India to Sri Lanka and then to Southeast Asia and China,” he said.
 
 This cross-fertilization of Buddhist practice was facilitated by ancient maritime trade routes that existed long before the Romans famously began to write of Sri Lanka’s riches, he argued.
 
 “The island of Lanka played a vital role in transmitting merchandise between East and West, and North and South. Because of this, the political, religious and cultural history of Sri Lanka reflect the fluctuations of the markets, changing patterns of trading destinations, and the evolution of Buddhist philosophies,” he said.
 
 Put simply, trade in commodities accompanied a trade in culture, ideas, and beliefs.
 
 This recognition has implications that reverberate even today.
 
 Pre-Roman trade routes
 
 Mainstream histories of Sri Lanka’s importance to maritime trade routes often begin with early Roman descriptions of the island.
 
 The Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy, for example, drew a map of Sri Lanka in the 2nd century CE. In it, the island appears about ten times its current size, possibly reflecting its geographical importance to ancient traders.
 
 But in fact, long before the Roman Empire took control of Egypt and its valuable Red Sea trade route in 30 BC, India and Sri Lanka were engaged in “a dynamic regional maritime network based on coastal navigation,” Bopearachchi said.
 
 The recent discovery of an ancient shipwreck near the village of Godavaya off the island’s Southern coast is proof of this fact.
 
 “The (wreck), dating from the 2nd or 1st century BC, belongs to a period when Romans were still not engaged with Indian Ocean trade,” Bopearachchi said. This find “has revolutionized our knowledge of the history of maritime trade in South Asia,” he added.
 
 In ancient times, Sri Lanka was trading in precious goods like ivory, tortoise shells, and gems, he said. So when the Romans did begin to navigate the Indian Ocean, they were entering a previously established market.
 
 The Romans took Sri Lanka’s goods all over the ancient world. A blue sapphire discovered on the site of Alexandria on the Caucasus, in modern-day Afghanistan, dating back to the 1st or 2nd century CE, is just one example of this North-South trade, Bopearachchi said.
 
 The influence of Mahayana
 
 But ivory and gems were not the only things flowing along these ancient trade routes. Traders also passed along their religious practices and beliefs.
 
 “During the first three centuries of the common era, South Indian traders played an integral role between Alexandrian traders and Sri Lankans,” Bopearachchi said. “As a result, they came from Andhra and Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in search of merchandise.”
 
 He said that while visiting religious monuments in Sri Lanka, these traders would have brought plaques as offerings to the island’s Buddhist establishment.
 
 
 
 Professor Osmund Bopearachchi.
 
 This explains why some reliefs in Andhra style, depicting scenes from the life of the Buddha, have been found in religious monuments of Sri Lanka, he said.
 
 “Cultural interactions between Andhra and Sri Lanka made the Buddhist communities closer,” he said. A branch of the Mahavihara in Anuradhapura was established in Andhra Pradesh, he said, and Mahayana Buddhism flourished at the Abhayagiri monastery.
 
 Indeed, in 2010, while undergoing conservation of the Abhayagiri stupa, archeologists discovered a tablet carrying Tantric Mahayana inscriptions dating to the 8th century CE.
 
 Bopearachchi said that discoveries from around the 7th and 8th centuries show that Mahayana Boddhisattva statues actually outnumbered Buddha images on the island. They are scattered along the island’s ports, rivers, and overland routes.
 
 Because the Boddhisattva Avalokitesvara was believed to be the protector of sailors and travelers, the presence of Boddhisattva statues “shows widespread Mahayana practice” in Sri Lanka, he said.
 
 Professor Justin Henry, an American scholar of religious history, takes a more textual approach to the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. But he agrees with many of Bopearachchi’s positions.
 
 He said that medieval kings are sometimes identified as Boddhisattvas in various texts and inscriptions. “The inscriptional, art-historical, and literary record of the 9th and 10th centuries evidences an injection of Mahayana imagery and vocabulary into Sri Lankan Buddhism that would have enduring effects,” he said in an interview.
 
 It is in this context of hybridity, the historians argue, that the famed spread of Buddhism east from Sri Lanka to Southeast Asia must be understood.
 
 Buddhism on the move
 
 In the 7th century, trade between Chinese, Arab, Persian, and South Indian merchants exploded, connecting Sri Lanka to Southeast and East Asia in new and profound ways.
 
 “It was with the sudden burst of trade activities between China and the Middle East in the 7th century that Sri Lanka began to play a decisive role between East and West,” Bopearachchi said.
 
 Sri Lanka’s increased importance in the context of trade also meant a wider spread of its religious beliefs and practices.
 
 An emblematic story is that of Vajrabodhi, a South Indian Vajrayana Buddhist monk. Vajrabodhi eventually went to serve in the Tang Court of 8th century China.
 
 En route to China, Vajrabodhi stopped in Sri Lanka, to pay homage to the tooth relic at Abhayagiri and to climb Sri Pada and worship the Buddha’s footprint, according to a biography written by his disciple.
 
 Leaving Sri Lanka from modern-day Beruwala, he was accompanied by 35 Persian ships trading in precious stones.
 
 This episode is a case study in the “diffusion of Buddhist thought and information on maritime trade in the Indian Ocean,” Bopearachchi said.
 
 Pre-dating Vajrabodhi even, King Mahanama in the 5th century sent Sinhalese Buddhist nuns to preside over an ordination ceremony in China during the Song Dynasty.
 
 Sri Lanka made contact with Thailand in the same century, Bopearachchi said, and “close links between Sri Lanka and Burma certainly paved the way for iconographies based on Pali literature.”
 
 He said Pali may have even served as the lingua franca between the two cultures.
 
 “The spread of Buddhism from South Asia to Southeast Asia is closely connected to the growth of maritime networks based on trade that facilitated the movement of Buddhist merchants, traveling monks, and traders,” he said.
 
 Where is Sri Lanka now?
 
 Other scholars and historians think that the lessons of Bopearachchi’s argument have implications on culture and trade today.
 
 Professor Emeritus Gamini Keerawella, the Executive Director of the Regional Centre for Strategic Studies, said he believed it was important to push back against the “very parochial, very narrow” modern view of history.
 
 That view is often “misused to explain present political developments,” he said. Examining current phenomena, like China’s “One Belt One Road” development initiative, should not be viewed through a simplified lens.
 
 Instead of the popular notion that the belt and road are indicative of a resurgence of Chinese imperial ambition, it should instead be analyzed as complex and rooted in a variety of internal and external political factors, he argued.
 
 Senior Professor Amal Kumarage, of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, said he was shocked that there were 35 ships anchored at the ancient harbour near Beruwala. “I’m not sure Hambantota has had that many,” he said.
 
 But Sri Lanka Ports Authority Logistics Director Upali de Zoysa pushed back. “To attract traffic to a new port it takes time,” he said. “Aided by a Chinese plan to develop an industrial zone around the port, it will take 10-15 years to get off the ground,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Hambantota is surrounded in myriad of controversies that sometimes sloppily mix arguments of sovereignty, foreign intrusion, domestic political strife, and debt. The situation, which has trade at its root, is inextricably linked with culture and history. It will be the job of future historians to untangle the threads.
 
 Reflecting on ancient trade routes, it’s clear that “Sri Lanka was the centre of the world,” Bopearachchi said at the academic forum.

These dangerous measures of unilateralism and protectionism are very likely to seriously damage the global economy that is undergoing a difficult recovery, impacting on everyone, in one way or the other.
 
 From a deeper perspective, how countries around the world respond to these challenges is a matter of principle: whether or not we will follow international trade rules, defend the multilateral commercial system, and promote economic globalization? We once again stand at the crossroads of human history, and have a major choice to make between openness and isolation, between progress and retreat.
 
 At this important moment of the future of mankind, President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference on April 10th 2018, and gave a firm answer of the Communist Party and the Government of China to this question.
 
 In his speech, President Xi reviewed the achievements of China’s reform and opening up for the last 40 years, and pointed out a most valuable inspiration: Any country or nation wishing to achieve rejuvenation must follow the trend of the history and times in their pursuit of progress and development. Just as an ancient Chinese classic teaches that heaven has its own law and those who embrace it will prosper.
 
 Broadening market access
 
 President Xi highlighted that we live at a time with an overwhelming trend toward peace and cooperation, openness and connectivity, reform and innovation. Reliance on cold-war and zero-sum mentality looks even more out of place in such times. Openness leads to progress while seclusion leaves one behind. With the future in mind, we should stay committed to build an open global economy, uphold the multilateral trading system, and jointly make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.
 
 At the end of the speech, President Xi reaffirmed that China would advance reform and opening-up, and announced measures for further measures in that direction, including broadening market access, improving investment environment, strengthening intellectual property rights protection, and expanding imports from foreign countries.
 
 This is the experience of China’s 40 years of reform and opening up, and also a strategic choice made by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the future of human society. China would always stay determined to build world peace, contribute to global prosperity and uphold the international order.
 
 Facing the US Trump administration’s attempt to unilaterally wage a trade war against China, Beijing has taken firm countermeasures in the first place. China’s position on this issue is very clear: It neither wants a trade war nor willing to fight a trade war. But if a country insists to provoke one, China will follow suit to the very end, taking all necessary measures to defend its rights and interests, and safeguard the rules-based international trading system.
 
 It is gratifying to note that more and more countries, including Europe, Japan, India, and Singapore etc., choose to support trade liberalization and economic globalization in various ways. At the same time, many insightful people from the US political, business and academic community also came forward to explicitly oppose trade protectionism.
 
 It fully demonstrates that economic globalization is still the trend in the world, and the “isolated island” of protectionism will eventually be abandoned by this wave.
 
 Sino-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation
 
 Both China and Sri Lanka have benefited from WTO and the global trade rules, which have contributed to China’s reform and opening up, and also made Sri Lanka a jewel in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka, with its unique geographical location, has always been actively participating in economic globalization. Under the guidance of the important consensus reached by the leaders of our two countries, the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, and the tide of economic globalization, Sino-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation has developed rapidly.
 
 The comprehensive development project of the Hambantota Port has proceeded smoothly and Sri Lanka has added a new important portal to the outside world. The construction of the Port City Colombo is steadily progressing day by day, on which many overseas investors have shown strong interest.
 
 The Economic Corridors of Colombo-Hambantota, Colombo-Kandy are also set to flourish. With all these collaborative efforts, economic development of the island nation is expected to embark on the fast track. As long as it adheres to trade liberalization and economic globalization, Sri Lanka’s great dream of becoming an important economic center in Asia would surely be realized in coming years.
 
 China is willing to work together with all countries, including Sri Lanka, to safeguard the multilateral trading system, promote further development of economic globalization, build a new form of international relations and a community of shared destiny, so as to bring greater welfare and brighter future to the people of the world.","['global', 'upholding', 'trade', 'economic', 'measures', 'lanka', 'china', 'globalization', 'sri', 'reform', 'world']","{'China': 11, 'India': 2, 'Japan': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 8, 'Singapore': 1, 'United States': 3}",,,,,
411,Daily News,http://www.dailynews.lk/2017/05/31/features/117490/flooded-woes,0.3,,Sri Lanka,E,2017-05-31 00:00:00,Flooded with woes,"The massive downpour and the subsequent floods experienced especially in the districts of Ratnapura, Kalutara, Matara, Galle and Hambantota dominated the TV and newspaper headlines last week. The floods have so far claimed more than 180 lives with 112 missing and 557,500 people displaced. Only the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami had claimed more lives and displaced more people. The floods that occurred in recent years did not claim so many lives.
 
 Two words could summarise this huge tragedy: Disaster Unpreparedness. There have been many allegations in the media and by the affected people that the responsible agencies were either not aware of the magnitude of the looming rains or ignored the warning signs. In fact, nearly all the agencies dealing with disaster preparedness were caught unawares as the catastrophe unfolded. A visibly angry Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at an especially convened meeting at Temple Trees did not mince his words when he blamed the responsible agencies for failing to inform each other and coordinate the response to the situation. This institutional failure must be remedied with immediate effect because we seem to be prone to natural disasters with alarming regularity.
 
 Although Sri Lanka has been having a Disaster Management Centre (DMC) for several years, what is worrying is the lack of a long-term plan for disaster preparedness and mitigation. Instead, ad-hoc measures are adopted every time a disaster occurs, be it floods, landslides or even the recent collapse of a garbage mound in Meethotamulla. This response is usually chaotic and does not serve the victims very well. This time, the DMC and other agencies were totally unprepared for the events that took place. On Saturday when others perused the essential items list in the disaster preparedness agencies it indicated ZERO. There was nobody to take responsibility for this huge mistake. The lack of coordination and a huge communications gap prevailed. The Prime Minister pinpointed that there was a huge communication gap among the Government agencies.
 
 The Government agencies even said that landslides occurred in areas where they never expected.
 
 This is an irresponsible statement by the disaster preparedness agencies including the National Building Research Organization (NBRO). They should constantly check for developments in the landslide map and take precautions where necessary. In Sri Lanka, we are generally wise after an event, not before it. This trend should be changed at least now.
 
 For starters, they all knew that a very long drought usually culminates in a massive downpour for which you have to be prepared. They could have used army camps and other Security Forces installations spread throughout the country to store essentials and even boats. That is what neighbouring India does and India responded to our call very fast since they had supplies in the Tuticorin Naval base and rapid deployment was possible. So far, a couple of Indian ships have arrived here with supplies.
 
 A long–term plan and national policy for disaster preparedness and mitigation must be formulated even at this late stage. It should cover everything from food preparation to the temporary shelter for the victims, leading up to resettlement and reconstruction. The proper roles of all the agencies should be clearly spelt out and the roles that can be played by the Security Forces, the private sector, NGOs and the public should also be taken into account. There is now a tendency to pass on all aspects of the search and rescue effort to the Security Forces and the Police. This should not be the case. Civilian agencies must necessarily be involved.
 
 Proper disaster management plan
 
 Among the agencies that must be included in a proper disaster management plan (not in any particular order) are the DMC, NBRO, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, Coastal Conservation Department, Marine Pollution Prevention Authority, Urban Development Authority, Highways Ministry and Road Development Authority, Health Ministry, Education Ministry, Met Department, Security Forces and Police, Provincial Councils and Local Bodies, Divisional Secretariats, Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon Electricity Board and Lanka Electricity Company (LECO), Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the SLTB and Railways Department (this list is not exhaustive).
 
 It should be a holistic approach to every type of disaster imaginable including earthquakes. Experts are of the opinion that an even an earthquake could occur around Sri Lanka due to recent geological phenomena. Floods and droughts are occurring more frequently in our part of the world due to the phenomenon of global warming. Indeed, man is responsible for the fallout of damaging the natural environment. Deforestation, soil erosion, excessive fuel consumption, indiscriminate waste disposal, unauthorised constructions on water retention and landslide-prone areas and other such aberrations take a heavy toll on the environment. There could be more floods in flood prone areas and a prolonged drought in drought-prone areas. This was quite apparent when floods were experienced in one area but the effects of the drought continued in other areas such as the North Central Province (NCP) with little or no rain.
 
 The problem with the Sri Lankan psyche is that we come up with grand designs which often fall by the wayside after a few months. We will forget even this flood in two weeks and wake up only when another flood strikes next year or year after next. The USAID some time back gave a proposal to set up a rapid response team but this seems to have gone into cold storage in some obscure place. A disaster management centre was to be established in Katunayake close to the BIA but after having done all architectural designs it remains a mere proposal. These are shortcomings that have to be addressed urgently.
 
 Things get even worse when Government agencies act on false information or act on their own without getting the correct facts. In one instance, the Police jumped the gun in Bandaragama and Wadduwa areas alerting the people of a major bund burst in the vicinity but it was found to be a false alarm. The Government together with telecom firms developed a rapid SMS alert system following the tsunami, which could be extended to other disaster types and perhaps targeted at subscribers in certain stipulated areas. The public will then have confidence that it is a verified warning or alert. We are a very politically active nation and we tend to blame the Government for everything, the weather included. While the Government cannot indeed do anything about the fury of nature which is unleashed from to time, it can take certain steps to prepare for and in the aftermath of a disaster. This is what the Premier insisted on at the meeting in Temple Trees, where he exhorted Ministers and MPs from the flood affected areas to be in their respective electorates/districts at this time. The only exception was granted to Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa (who was in Mexico attending a conference) and Acting Minister Dunesh Gankanda who have to coordinate relief efforts from the DMC in Colombo. This is seen as a very good move since there have been many public complaints that Ministers and MPs rarely visit their electorates even in a normal situation. Some have not visited their hometowns for months. (It is a mystery as to where they go because many seats in Parliament are also empty on any given sitting day). It is hoped that the flood will motivate them to visit their respective areas for relief work.
 
 The Cabinet of Ministers decided to stop the importation of vehicles for ministries and ministers this year, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday. This was also confirmed by Minister Harin Fernando via his Twitter feed.
 
 The Government faced criticism from the media and the Opposition earlier for deciding to import a number of new vehicles for certain ministers and ministries.
 
 Minister Fernando’s Twitter post said in the aftermath of the flood devastation, the Cabinet has decided to cancel all vehicle imports for Ministries this year. Samarasinghe said the President had directed that funds allocated to purchase the vehicles be used to provide relief for the flood victims. Ministers will be requested to use the vehicles they already have.
 
 A supplementary estimate to seek Parliament’s approval to get Rs.360 million to purchase vehicles for some ministers and renovate the official residences of several other ministers was presented last week.
 
 New Cabinet Ministers
 
 Most other political developments took a backseat during the past week as the country grappled with the floods. Most of the newly appointed Cabinet Ministers began work without much fanfare, given the flood situation. The focus was very much on the two ‘swapped’ ministries – Foreign and Finance. Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, in an interview with our sister newspaper
 
 The Sunday Observer, blamed two unnamed officials for his ousting from the Finance Ministry. However, he said he would be committed 100 percent to his new job, paying more attention to trade and commercial diplomacy, which would be more familiar for him to start with. It appears that he will retain control of the two lotteries boards and a few other institutions from his old ministry. This is a unique situation and there were reports that several other ministers have requested similar arrangements which have apparently been shot down by the President and the Prime Minister.
 
 Meanwhile, at the Finance Ministry, Minister Mangala Samaraweera also faces a steep learning curve and has only around six months to formulate Budget 2018, which is a daunting task for even an experienced Finance Minister, leave alone someone completely new to the job. Again, his experience as Foreign Minister should come in handy, as Finance is now very much an internationalised subject given the closer global economic integration.
 
 The One Belt One Road (OBOR) project is one such initiative that seeks to bring the world closer together. Spearheaded by China, the project will basically more closely connect Europe and Asia by land and sea. Sri Lanka features prominently in OBOR maps. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who led the Sri Lankan delegation to the recently concluded OBOR Summit in Beijing, forwarded a Cabinet paper on the same. Leaders from countries such as Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Argentina, Belarus, Chile, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Turkey, Vietnam, Cambodia, Fiji, Hungary, Italy, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Poland were present at this discussion.
 
 According to cabinet paper presented by the Premier, excerpts from the Joint Communiqué issued by the leaders are as follows:
 
 a) Pursuing dialogue and consultation in order to build synergies in development strategies among participating countries, noting the efforts to strengthen cooperation in coordinating the development of the Belt and Road initiative with other plans and initiatives and to promote partnerships among Europe; Asia, South America, Africa and other regions.
 
 b) Conducting in-depth consultation on macroeconomic issues by optimising the existing multilateral and bilateral cooperation and dialogue mechanisms, so as to provide a robust policy support for practical cooperation and the implementation of major projects.
 
 c) Strengthening cooperation on innovation, by supporting innovation action plans for e-commerce, digital economy, smart cities and science and technology parks, and by encouraging greater exchanges on innovation and business start-up models in the Internet age in respect of intellectual property rights.
 
 d) Promoting practical cooperation on roads, railways, ports, maritime and inland water transport, aviation, energy pipelines, electricity, fibre optic including trans-oceanic cable, telecommunications and information and communication technology.
 
 e) Promoting public-private partnership in areas that create more jobs and generate greater efficiency; welcoming international financial institutions to increase support and investment for infrastructure development.
 
 f) Deepening economic and trade cooperation; promoting trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation; enabling the general public to benefit from trade
 
 g) Expanding trade by nurturing new areas of trade growth, promoting trade balance and promoting e-commerce and the digital economy, welcoming the development of free trade areas and signing of free trade agreements by interested countries.
 
 h) Advancing of global value chains development and supply chain connectivity.
 
 i) Enhancing cooperation in the protection of the environment, biodiversity and natural resources, addressing the adverse impacts of climate change, advancing of renewable energy and energy efficiency.
 
 j) Enhancing customs cooperation with a view to costs.
 
 k) Jointly working on a long-term, stable and financial infrastructure and connectivity to facilitating trade including by harmonising the sustainable financing system
 
 L) Encouraging dialogues among civilisations, cultural exchanges, promoting tourism and protecting the world’s cultural and natural heritage.
 
 This understanding would result in synergizing connectivity of development policies- and strategies, deepening project cooperation for infrastructure connectivity, expanding industrial investments and enhancing the financial cooperation and financial connectivity among the countries which are part of the roundtable discussion.
 
 OBOR also ties in perfectly with the Colombo International Financial City (Port City) and the Western Province Megapolis plan which aim to develop the Western region. Sri Lankans must give up their island mentality in order to get ahead. Closer integration with the world economy is essential for this to happen. Both Colombo and Hambantota Ports are essential cogs in the OBOR wheel.
 
 Incidentally, new Ports Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe has vowed to restore the former glory of the Colombo Port which has the potential to become one of the top 10 ports in the world (Present ranking 23). Finance, Foreign and Ports Ministries will have to work together to make Sri Lanka an even bigger hub for world trade.","['agencies', 'floods', 'disaster', 'minister', 'flooded', 'areas', 'trade', 'cooperation', 'flood', 'ministers', 'sri', 'woes']","{'Argentina': 1, 'Belarus': 1, 'Switzerland': 1, 'Chile': 1, 'China': 1, 'Spain': 1, 'Fiji': 1, 'Hungary': 1, 'Indonesia': 1, 'India': 3, 'Italy': 1, 'Cambodia': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 8, 'Mexico': 1, 'Myanmar': 1, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Peru': 1, 'Philippines': 1, 'Poland': 1, 'Turkey': 1, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja made these views on the first day of the ‘Asia Liberty Forum 2019,’ held at the Hilton Hotel, Colombo. The two -day forum is being organized by the Advocata Institute, Sri Lanka.
 
 Noting that country would face the reality of debt overheads despite that fact that who would come to power following the results of the upcoming Presidential election and Parliamentary election to be held by the end of this year and next year respectively, he said.
 
 “It is the responsibility of successive governments to place the economy on a sounder footing to revive growth and most importantly to accrue benefits to the ordinary citizens,” he added.
 
 Speaking on the common challenges faced by the South Asian region, he pointed out three main challenges, which include the political instability in the region, mainly due to the escalating conflict between Pakistan and India, the upcoming elections in India and Sri Lanka and most importantly, specific issues relating to the One belt-One Road initiative of China.
 
 He further said that China had inspired the infrastructure growth and investment model, while the western inspired growth model had been poorly implemented in Sri Lanka.
 
 Speaking on the Economic freedom and political freedom in the South Asian region, he said, “On the economic freedom front, South Asia has done something reasonably, but still it is fairly protected. South Asia may be somewhat ahead of the economic freedom front, but on the personal freedom side, South Asia did not do well.”

Instead, he emphasized that the rest of the countries in the region need to deal with it in a pragmatic manner.

Islanders, including Sri Lankans, have what is called an “island mentality” where they tend to think that they can live insulated from the outside world. But this simply does not happen in real life. Links with the outside world are crucial especially for an island nation such as Sri Lanka with no land connections to a bigger continent.
 
 But unlike most other islands, Sri Lanka occupies a very strategic location on the East-West sea route, a sort of halfway house between the Suez and Singapore. This means that Sri Lanka has often figured in the geopolitical ambitions of regional and global superpowers. The challenge, then, is to remain neutral without getting caught up in these power plays.
 
 This is exactly what Non-Alignment is all about. Sri Lanka is a founder member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) that started in Belgrade in 1961, which itself was preceded by the Bandung Conference of 1955. The fifth NAM Conference was held in 1976 in Colombo under the patronage of the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Although some critics lament that the NAM may have lost its relevance in today’s geopolitical scenarios, the concept of Non-Alignment is still very much relevant.
 
 The last few years witnessed Sri Lanka veering away from these principles, after former President Mahinda Rajapaksa kept Sri Lanka firmly within the Non-Aligned orbit till 2015. There was a pronounced shift towards the West in terms of foreign policy at the expense of Sri Lanka’s traditional allies in the East during the last four years. The West is no doubt important being a significant trading and diplomatic partner, but this has to be a balanced approach. Western nations also have a tendency to focus too much on extraneous issues, a trend not seen in the relationship with Asian or Eastern countries. In this respect, there is already an indication of revisiting the UNHRC resolutions that were inimical to the interests of Sri Lanka.
 
 Non-aligned foreign policy
 
 President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has understood these complexities completely in formulating his foreign policy. In his nationally televised inaugural address to the Nation from the sacred precincts of the Ruwanweli Maha Seya, President Rajapaksa articulated the need for a non-aligned foreign policy where Sri Lanka does not lean towards one bloc or another. He also stressed that Sri Lanka wishes to have no part in any geopolitical conflicts or power games among regional and global superpowers. This approach of “friendly relations with all nations” has since been hailed by foreign policy experts and commentators.
 
 When it comes to rejuvenating a moribund foreign policy, regional relations come first. Many Sri Lankan leaders have described India, our giant neighbour to the North, as a “brother”, which is why President Gotabaya Rajapaksa too has chosen India for his first official visit. There was a time when even relations with India turned sour, but fences have now been mended, especially with the ascension of Gotabaya Rajapaksa to the presidency. India was among the first countries to congratulate the new President on his victory. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa have a nationalistic, patriotic outlook that has given their countries a new standing in the world. The duo will no doubt strike a personal and professional relationship that will immensely benefit both countries.
 
 The President must also focus on the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) which is yet to realise its full potential. Tensions between India and Pakistan have stymied its output, but if SAARC can resolve such issues and move forward, it will benefit the entire South Asian region. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa should work with other SAARC leaders to make SAARC a top-tier regional bloc that will one day have borderless travel.
 
 Sri Lanka must also strengthen its links with the other Buddhist countries – it is humiliating that Sri Lankans have to apply for visas to visit even the less developed Buddhist countries in the region whereas we give them free visas on arrival. The President must lead an effort to change this situation.
 
 Sri Lanka also has a prominent place in China’s One Belt One Road initiative which some have described as that country’s attempt to gain a foothold in the region. It is no secret that the world is watching with a keen eye China and India’s maneuverings in this part of the world. It is mostly to factors such as this President Rajapaksa alluded to in his speech. In an interview given to an Indian website, President Rajapaksa did not hesitate to call a spade a spade, saying the previous Government’s deal with China on the Hambantota International Port was downright wrong. It is now likely that this deal will be renegotiated.
 
 Sri Lankan Diaspora
 
 The President has also not forgotten the Sri Lankan Diaspora, whose contribution will be invaluable for rebuilding the country. Sections of the Tamil community in the Diaspora must now realise that there is no hope of achieving a separate country in Sri Lanka.
 
 Furthermore, some of these agitators have never even been to Sri Lanka and they do not speak the native languages either. It is time that they accepted the President’s invitation to join the national development drive. Thousands of Sri Lankan expatriates came back to Sri Lanka to cast their votes for the President – let us hope that they accept his invitation to help Mother Lanka at this hour of need.
 
 The two appointments made so far by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in the foreign affairs arena offers hope for better and bigger things to come. Dinesh Gunawardena, though new to the Foreign Affairs portfolio, is an experienced politician with a pragmatic worldview who has held several ministerial portfolios in previous administrations. He will be ably assisted by Foreign Secretary Ravinatha Aryasinha who has decades of experience on the global stage, including Geneva.
 
 The President will do well to appoint more qualified Foreign Service officials (career diplomats) especially to key capitals, with eminent personalities from other fields too drawn in where applicable. They are the voice of Sri Lanka in foreign capitals from Abuja to Zagreb and must necessarily be top-notch individuals who can articulate the President’s vision and mission for foreign relations to the rest of the world.","['dimensions', 'regional', 'president', 'foreign', 'lanka', 'india', 'gotabaya', 'sri', 'policy', 'world', 'rajapaksa']","{'China': 3, 'India': 7, 'Sri Lanka': 22, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Singapore': 1}",,,,,

The Chinese government is also confident that that the project has successfully navigated troubled waters.
 
 Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry Counselor and South Asian Division Director Chen Feng speaking to a group of media personnel visiting China said the new government of Sri Lanka has communicated that the port city project would be continued.
 
 Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry Counsellor and South Asian Division Director Chen Feng.
 
 ""We welcome this decision. After the recent mutual visits by the leaders of the two countries, we felt that the new government has a very keen and positive attitude to China-Sri Lanka cooperation,""he said.
 
 Last week Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, while addressing an event held to mark the 30th anniversary of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), spoke of the ""unique financial and business district"" the Colombo Port City project would create. He expressed keenness for the project to recommence.
 
 The project which begun under the last regime ran into stormy weather as the then opposition and activists questioned its viability and its possible adverse impact. After widespread opposition and pressure from activist groups in the aftermath of Presidential elections on January 8 the project was put on hold until additional assessments were conducted and the approvals given by the previous government were re-evaluated.
 
 The Supplementary Environment Impact Assessment has now been concluded, and the report was submitted to the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department. The report is accessible to the public in 11 different government institutions. A final decision on the environment impact will be made by the department after considering public responses.
 
 Referring to the issues the project faced from the beginning of the year Feng said that difficulties were not unique to this project only.
 
 ""We saw that there were some difficulties in bilateral projects because of the political changes in Sri Lanka. However, most of these projects have now returned to normalcy,"" he said.
 
 China's interest on the Colombo port city and Hambantota harbour is no doubt linked to its geo-political strategy in South Asia. Sri Lanka has been a strategic partner of the programme ever since the 'One Belt-One Road' concept was announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013.
 
 The 'One Belt-One Road' concept is a twofold strategy that focuses on connectivity and cooperation among countries in Eurasia. It envisages developing a 'Silk Road Economic Belt' connecting cities in Europe and Asia by land and a '21st century Maritime Silk Route' connecting ports via contiguous water bodies.
 
 This will allow China to play a bigger role in international economic affairs and realize its geo-political ambitions.
 
 A model of an international port city in Northern China.
 
 The Colombo Port city is designed to be built on an artificially created island of about 575 acres (233 hectares) on reclaimed land near to the Colombo port. This 1.4 billion USD project is undertaken by the China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC), which is a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Ltd. (CCCC).
 
 The port city, comprising high-rise buildings including hotels, apartment residencies and high-end shopping malls will continue with slight changes to the initial agreements signed by the previous regime in 2014.
 
 The Colombo port city and Hambantota harbour link Sri Lanka to the '21st century Maritime Silk Road' that extends from China's coasts through the South China sea, Indian Ocean, Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea with a stop in North Africa.
 
 The‘Silk Road Economic Belt’ and ‘21st Century Maritime Silk Road’
 
 China has been a close ally in development initiatives over the past years in Sri Lanka and has been a friend for all seasons. However, when giving the nod to go ahead with the port city, Sri Lanka may have to find its own manoeuvres to balance its relations with India and the US. It is no secret that both these countries have been sceptical over the China funded port city because of its strategic location.
 
 Chen Feng, during his meeting with Sri Lankan media personnel in Beijing, was also cautious to give the impression that the China's growing presence in the region was to accomplish common prosperity.
 
 ""We are developing friendly relations with all the neighbouring countries including India. In the recent years China-India relations are developing very fast. China and India now have a better mutual understanding. China's developing relations with Sri Lanka is not to compete with other countries,"" he said.""
 
 ""Our only purpose is to improve further bilateral relations. As our President proposed the idea of 'One Belt-One Road', it covers all the neighbouring countries, especially the South and Central Asia. The purpose is to realize common prosperity. Sri Lanka is one of the most important partners of China in the 21st Maritime Silk Road,"" he said.
 
 Chen Feng also expressed China's willingness to help Sri Lanka to improve infrastructure and create more employment opportunities, thereby contributing to the well-being of ordinary people.
 
 ""As friendly neighbours, the two countries have very good cooperation in economic development. China is developing very fast. We also want to see that our development can benefit neighbouring countries. The new government of Sri Lanka hopes to expedite the construction of industry parks and attract more foreign investments. China has the ability and strong desire to extend cooperation in areas of infrastructure and industry. There is smooth progress in the construction of China funded kidney hospital and water treatment centres in the areas affected by chronic kidney disease.
 
 There are more opportunities in Sri Lanka for investment and the Chinese government has encouraged Chinese companies to invest in Sri Lanka,"" he said.
 
 Despite repeated assertions from the Chinese and Sri Lankan governments lately that the port city project will go ahead, certain environmental issues are still unanswered.

 Over 45 percent of the reclamation work of the US $ 15 billion Colombo Port City project has been completed, CHEC Port City Colombo (PVT) LTD Chief Sales and Marketing Officer Liang Thow Ming said yesterday.
 
 Addressing the media at the China Harbour Engineering Company LTD premises in Beijing yesterday, he said that reclamation work is in progress with three dredgers depositing sand to build up the land mass.
 
 “We expect to complete reclamation work and marine structures by 2019. Initial infrastructure work and the construction of channel will be completed by 2020,” Ming said.
 
 Meanwhile, the construction of beach, marina and the central park will be completed by 2021, while work on the International Financial Centre will be completed by 2023. According to the schedule, other construction work will be completed by 2026.
 
 He said the port city project which was suspended for 16 months recommenced in October last year with the signing of a new tripartite agreement between Sri Lanka and China incorporating amendments emphasising the protection of the natural environment.
 
 “There were misconceptions of the environmental damage. We had to produce an additional report to clear up the misunderstanding. We are concerned about the rules and regulations on the environment imposed by the government,” Ming said.
 
 He said the new version of the Port City would be part of the Government’s Megapolis project and also of China’s development strategy of one belt-one road. The master plan has been approved by the UDA. Parks and open spaces have been accorded priority to promote a clean and green identity under the strategy of green and blue, he said.
 
 “The project will focus on making Colombo the best livable city in South Asia and fostering growth in the country,” he said.
 
 Ming said the revamped Port City project has been extended from the initial 233 hectares to 269 hectares. The project will be South Asia’s premiere residential, retail and business destination, offering unmatched planned city along the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, he said.
 
 It will also create more than 83,000 jobs, he said.
 
 The development will have two road connections creating an internal loop serving the master plan. These will link to a new underground tunnel for access to the South and a new flyover expressway, cutting the drive time from the airport to 30 minutes and connecting the expressway network to major cities in the country, Ming said.","['city', 'port', 'reclamation', 'colombo', 'construction', 'ming', 'work', 'south', 'completed', 'project', '45']","{'China': 3, 'India': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 “We need the fullest support from the Bank of China.The bank’s presence here in our country will be the strength for us to become the financial centre,” the PM said speaking at the opening of the Bank of China at Shangri-La hotel on Wednesday.
 
 “We have been able to build a stronger economy during the past three years.The Bank of China is the fourth largest bank in the world and the bank has come to Sri Lanka to commence its business. It’s a new chapter in the modern economic history of Sri Lanka and China.”
 
 “The common understanding between the two countries has grown much more and the One Belt One Road (OBOR) Initiative proposed by China and the hub of the Indian Ocean was proposed by Sri Lanka,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
 
 “We in the last three years have also taken major steps to ensure that Sri Lanka’s economy developed and became much stronger.We are open to the world.”
 
 “We have developed the Colombo Port and now we are developing the Hambantota Port as a joint venture between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and China Merchant Holdings.This is just the beginning of a larger area of economic cooperation, as Chinese investments are coming and other investments are coming into our country. “
 
 “This is why we have now taken the step of entering in to a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China in addition to what we have with Singapore and deepening the FTA with India, who are the largest markets.Then we will be accessible from Sri Lanka in addition to the European Union where we will have access to under the GSP plus,” the Premier said.
 
 Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan reiterated that Sri Lanka and China together form a robust partnership to augment world trade and commerce. “We are seeing a new era dawn for Sri Lanka, strengthening the relations the two countries have had both culturally and commercially for centuries. As Bank of China makes its mark in Sri Lanka, not only will it pave the way for numerous opportunities in developing trade and commerce between the two countries but will also pave the pathway for Sri Lanka to achieve its goal as the international finance and logistics hub for this region.”
 
 Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Bank of China Wang Xiquan said, “We are enthusiastic about this new chapter we are inking with Sri Lanka.This will not only support the Sri Lankan Government’s infrastructure development initiatives but will also strengthen Sri Lanka’s economy through Chinese investment.

 It is indeed a privilege to speak on the topic of geopolitics at the prestigious LKY School named after Lee Kuan Yew who is considered a guru of geopolitics and also called the “Kissinger of the orient”. According to Dr. S. Jaishankar “after being a driver of development and serving as an example for the continent, Lee Kuan Yew evolved in the eyes of the world to be sort of a geopolitical guru, guiding Asia and explaining the continent to the rest of the world”.
 
 The “great game” in the Indian Ocean
 
 According to Harsh V. Pant, “The ‘Great Game of this century will be played on the waters of the Indian Ocean. Though India’s location gives it great operational advantages in the IOR, it is by no means certain that New Delhi is in a position to hold on to its geographical advantages. China is rapidly catching up and its ties with Sri Lanka, are aimed at expanding its profile in this crucial part of the world. Indian policymakers realize that unless they are more proactive they might end up losing this ‘game’ for good”. “Colombo matters because the Indian Ocean matters”
 
 Former Secretary of State John Kerry’s report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2009, urges the US government to forge closer ties with Sri Lanka to prevent it from drifting into the “Chinese orbit”. Fast forward to this year, a visit by Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs - Alice Wells - to Sri Lanka, in September 2017, saw her tout the Trump foreign policy that: the US was seriously concerned over the “unsustainable debt burden on Sri Lanka due to non-concessional loans from China”.
 
 According to Robert Kaplan, Sri Lanka is a geostrategic hub. He considers “Sri Lanka part of the new [maritime] geography”. He also explains the geo-political symbolism of Sri Lanka’s location. “It’s part of China’s plan to construct a string of pearls – ports that they don’t own, but which they could use for their warships across the Indian Ocean”. In this regard, Hambantota Port is centre stage due to its geographical position and its Chinese-led development. Situated at the southern tip of Sri Lanka, Hambantota is adjacent to the busiest shipping lanes of the world.
 
 Most western scholars alike see China’s posturing in the IOR for military strategic reasons. However, Sri Lanka and China continue to emphasize the fact that the Sino-Lankan partnership is for “economic reasons and not for military reasons”. Currently, not many ships dock at Hambantota, the Chinese built port in the South of Sri Lanka and it is not as busy a harbour as the Colombo Port. Yet, this position will change with the development of the Gwadar Port and CPEC in full operation.
 
 Sri Lanka’s Geographical position
 
 The Indian Ocean covers approximately 20 percent of the water of the earth’s surface - 70,560,000 sqkm. The IOR is surrounded by the land masses of Asia, Africa and Australia and Antarctica. The Indian Ocean is named after the Indian subcontinent and has several choke points such as the Bab-el-Mandeb, the Strait of Hormuz, the Lombok Strait, the Strait of Malacca and the Palk Strait.
 
 14.6 percent of the world’s fish stock is caught in this region, according to the FAO. Around 36 million barrels per day - equivalent to about 40 per cent of the world’s oil supply and 64 per cent of oil trade - travel through the entry ways into and out of the Indian Ocean, including some of the aforementioned straits.
 
 The land masses surrounding the region are densely populated with over 2 billion people.
 
 Many Sri Lankan governments from time to time promote Sri Lanka as a hub. Actually this is not necessary, since we are already a hub geographically from ancient times.
 
 In ancient libraries of Alexandria, the island was called Taprobane, mapped in an oversized proportion by Ptolemy, the Greek-Egyptian cartographer. Sri Lanka was elongated on Ptolemy’s map due to its rich civilization and trade relations with the rest of the world.
 
 After the discovery and mapping of the Cape of Good Hope and the subsequent discovery of the Indian Ocean, Henricus Martellus’s world map (c.1489) also clearly depicts Sri Lanka.
 
 Sri Lanka could be defined as Sir Halford Mackinder’s outer crescent touching the rim land. Two other nations which have similar geographical positioning are the islands of Britain and Japan, having access to the Atlantic and to the Pacific oceans respectively, close to the continent, but separated by the ocean.
 
 Since Mackinder’s land-based-pivot-area strategy, the pivot area has veered towards having control of the oceans. In the same vein, Alfred Mahan’s statement that “whoever controls the Indian Ocean will dominate Asia, the destiny of the world will be decided on its waters”, has never been more apparent.
 
 Chinese Sphere of influence in IOR - Sino-Lankan Relations
 
 The Sino-Lankan relationship is one that dates back to the Chinese mariner - Zheng His visit to Sri Lanka in 1405, a century prior to Vasco Da Gama’s visit to this region in 1498. This confirms the Chinese interest in the IOR and Sri Lanka in particular, before the colonial period. The Sino-Lankan relationship has moved to a strategic relationship after the visit of President Xi and the resurrection of the ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative.
 
 Today, China is Sri Lanka’s second largest trading partner, surpassing the US and just behind India. Sino-Lankan trade remains at more than US $ 3 billion. Our economic partnership will only grow with the Chinese economic zone and Hambantota Port in full operation. By 2025, China will become Sri Lanka’s largest trading partner due to the significant investments in the island as well as in the region.
 
 Nevertheless, caution is being touted that, “Sri Lanka will not have the negotiation capacity and the economic strength to deter China when it wants a military base in the future”. The foreign policy of the Sri Lankan government is explicitly clear in the face of such conjectures: “The Sri Lankan Government does not make its bases available to foreign forces”.
 
 It’s also important to consider China’s geo-strategic disadvantages in the Indian Ocean when examining this point. According to Dr. David Brewster, “China’s strategic vulnerability is reinforced by the scarcity of overland transport connections between Chinese territory and the Indian Ocean.” He further states that China currently has no ability to exert control over the choke points nor has it any regular naval presence in any of the IOR ports.
 
 China’s presence on Land and Sea
 
 According to Abhijit Singh, “Despite denials by their regional leaders, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bangladesh are poised to witness a substantial expansion of China’s maritime footprint. The expansion of PLA Navy submarine activity in South Asia is quite in keeping with a powerful navy’s need to familiarise itself with alien operating conditions. The pattern of Chinese submarine visits reveals that the PLA Navy has been incrementally raising the complexity of its deployments, sending both conventional and nuclear submarines to learn more about the Indian Ocean’s operating environment.”
 
 Indian observers fear that Sri Lanka’s reluctance to allow basing facilities for PLA Navy warships and submarines immediately, will lead Beijing to consider Gwadar, Maldives, Chittagong (Bangladesh) or Kyaukphu (Myanmar) as alternative options. For New Delhi, China’s growing maritime involvement with these states, indicates a tightening strategic hold over the South Asian rim, a traditional Indian sphere of geo-political influence.
 
 This cautious atmosphere has been trumped up by the recent Chinese submarine encounters in the IOR that have arguably created a few ripples in the geopolitical context. According to Prof. Shen Dingli at Fudan University, “it is wrong for us to believe that we have no right to set up bases abroad”. He argues that China needs not only a blue-water navy but also overseas military bases to cut the supply cost.
 
 In the South China Sea Abijith Sing warns that “China itself has plans to build its own “Great Wall” under the South China Sea, through which 30 percent of the world’s trade passes. On the surface too, China has been increasingly assertive, having built a string of installations that include airstrips and other military facilities. To listen to underwater battle, India and Japan plan to install a sea wall of “hydrophones”—microphones with sensors, placed on the seabedbetween southern India and the northern tip of Indonesia.”
 
 The One Belt one Road Initiative (known commonly as OBOR) was a construct of the scholar - Wang Jisi’s strategic thinking, to have a significant Chinese footprint in Eurasia, especially to recalibrate the existing world order. The OBOR is the “project of the century”, according to President Xi Jinping. This trillion-dollar initiative aims to integrate Eurasia through the development of infrastructure. It is unquestionably the most ambitious project ever launched in recent times, which seeks to revisit and resurrect the Ming dynasty’s - admiral Zheng He’s global legacy. Thus, the OBOR, when it comes to fruition, will symbolize what I have been talking about in this section – the twin powers of China’s economic and military strength in the IOR.
 
 According to the World Economic Forum, by 2030 the US will no longer be the only superpower and China will be well placed among the many countries to become one of the great powers. The OBOR is the medium through which China envisions this new world order. Sri Lanka, with its geostrategic position at the centre of the Maritime Silk Road, is a ‘super-connector’ linking the east-west sea lanes. Therefore, as a nation we have a choice in how we calibrate our foreign policy based on this strategic advantage.
 
 Not all nations support China’s OBOR, India recently was absent from the OBOR Summit. According to LKY Prof Kanti Bajpai the real reason for India’s absence from the OBOR are quite different and it’s not the CPEC. It is galling to New Delhi that the entire world is lining up to do business with a rampant China and no one is paying India much attention. Envy apart, there is the strategic worry that China will ‘encircle’ India. That China with an economy five times the size of India, needs the BRI and an encirclement of India to deal with its weak neighbour is unlikely, but clearly this assumption motivates Indian strategic thinking.

Sri Lanka seeks to obtain their support for the promotion of trade and investments aimed at accelerating economic growth rate while providing employment to the unemployed youth and eradication of poverty. Sri Lanka is, in a way, very fortunate that both India and China have shown a very keen interest in integrating Sri Lanka’s economic development to their respective economic development plans for the region.
 
 The Sri Lankan government’s foreign policy perspective appears to be exploring the possibility of obtaining the support of other economic powers outside the region such as the European Economic Union, Japan and Australia also for her development projects. The Sri Lankan government has been able to sign a large number of agreements with these economic powers recently for promoting trade with these states and inducing investors of these countries to invest in Sri Lanka.
 
 In this article, I am attempting to draw the attention of the reader to a serious problem that Sri Lanka is confronted with in maintaining an equally close relationship with the two regional powers, India and China, because these regional powers have conflicting regional and global interests.
 
 Foreign policy of the previous regime
 
 It can be said that the foreign policy adopted by the Rajapaksa regime during the last stage of administration was irrational. The government adopted a confrontationist attitude when the members of the international community brought before the UNO some issues of human rights violations during the last stage of the war.
 
 This attitude of the Sri Lankan government resulted in many powerful states including India showing reluctance to contribute in a substantial way for implementing the development projects designed for rapid economic growth. Only China, the fastest growing economy, at the time, was willing to assist Sri Lanka by undertaking to grant financial assistance for the massive development projects such as the Hambantota port, Mattala airport and the Port City in Colombo.
 
 The Chinese government agreed to provide finance for the implementation of these projects. However, it is after the completion of the construction work of the Hambanthota port and the Mattala airport that the Sri Lankan government realised that these projects were economically not viable and the burden of paying foreign debts became a very serious economic problem for the government.
 
 After the change of government in 2015, the new government had suspended the construction work in the Port City, stating as a reason, the need for making a proper study of the agreement with the Chinese construction company and if necessary to make amendments to the agreement. Consequently, after several months, the Sri Lankan government permitted the Chinese construction company to go ahead with the construction of the Port City after making some amendments to the agreement. However, after taking into consideration the loss and damage caused to the Chinese company during the time that the construction work had been suspended, the Sri Lankan government undertook to pay compensation to the construction company in some form.
 
 The new government had no alternative but to seek the cooperation of China for making the running of the Hambanthota port an economically viable enterprise by signing necessary agreements for sharing the management of the port with the Chinese Company, China Merchant Port Holdings Company Ltd. Although a Concession Agreement and a Framework Agreement have been drafted, the Sri Lankan government seeks to amend some provisions to make the terms more favourable to Sri Lanka.
 
 Opposition to China’s involvement in development projects
 
 Even before the change of government, there was opposition to the involvement of China in the strategically important development projects such as sea ports and airports and granting management and control over such projects after the completion of the construction work. The critics of the China’s involvement in such projects pointed out that when China acquires an ability to have control over such assets in Sri Lanka for long periods, it results in the erosion of Sri Lanka’s sovereignty. Moreover, China is viewed as a rival state by India and India entertained the fear that in the event of a dispute between these two states escalating to the state of a military confrontation, there is a possibility of the assets such as sea ports under its control and management being used by China for military purposes.
 
 It cannot be said that the Sri Lankan government was not aware of the fact that China had designed a plan for constructing sea ports in strategically important locations in the littoral states of the Indian Ocean and several sea ports such as the port at Gwadar on the southern coast of Pakistan and Sittwe in Myanmar had already been constructed. It was viewed that these sea ports constructed by China were aimed at containing India which was considered as a rival state due to several inter-state issues between these two rising powers in Asia. India too had engaged in constructing new sea ports in the eastern coast of India with a view to expanding its maritime interests and preserving its dominance in the Indian Ocean.
 
 China’s One Belt One Road global project
 
 China, being a rising power with the vision of reaching the super power status has already assumed a world power status posing a challenge to the USA and also India. For reaching the super power status, China has to use its diplomacy for expanding its spheres of influence for finding markets, resources and assets for investments in other countries, not only in the region but also in other parts of the world.
 
 The concept of ancient Silk Road has been redefined as the One Belt One Road Initiative (OBOR). It is a massive infrastructure project financed by China to link the country with Africa, Asia and Europe through a network of ports, railways and industrial parks. However, this connectivity and development projects of China are viewed by other economic powers with suspicion. It is viewed as an attempt to attract economically weak countries seeking foreign aid for development, to China’s sphere of influence undermining the status enjoyed by other economic powers in Asia and in regions outside Asia.
 
 India cooperating with Japan for a counter-project
 
 Newspapers reported recently that India has sought the support of Japan for acting jointly for developing an Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) as a counter to China’s ambitious One Belt One Road also known as the New Silk Road project. The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, made reference to this while addressing the 52nd Annual General Meeting of the African Development Bank (ADB) at Gandhinagar, Gujarat’s capital, on May 23.
 
 The proposed project is largely meant to propel growth and investment in Africa by curtailing the ever increasing presence of the Chinese on the continent. The AAGC is an attempt to create a “Free and Open Indo - Pacific Region” by rediscovering ancient sea-routes and creating new sea corridors that will link the African continent with India and South East Asia. The idea is to enable economies in Asia and Africa to further integrate and collectively emerge as a globally competitive economic block.
 
 We are aware that India has assumed a role as the leader of the South Asian region considering that the geopolitical factor of neighborhood requires the small states in South Asia such as Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldive Islands and Bhutan to orient their relations with other states in such a manner that their policies should remain consistent with the foreign policy of India at any particular point in time.
 
 India considers that there is an obligation on the part of neighbouring states to consult India not only in the matter of taking foreign policy decisions but also regarding internal matters if they constitute a source of a threat to India’s security. For example, a civil war or political instability in a neighbouring state can be regarded as a potential threat to India’s security.
 
 India also considers that if a neighbouring state adopts an independent foreign policy disregarding India’s concerns or the government of a neighbouring state ignores India’s advice as to how an internal problem such as a civil war should be managed, there is an obligation on the part of India as the ‘Big Brother’ to intervene. Sri Lanka has already learnt lessons regarding the consequences of disregarding India’s concerns or fears in taking not only foreign policy decisions but also ignoring India’s advice regarding some internal problems.
 
 When we take into consideration some recently announced foreign policy decisions by two regional leaders, India and China, it appears that both these rising powers are engaged in a competition for expanding their spheres of influence both in their neighbourhood and also outside their immediate neighbourhood.
 
 It appears that India perceives China’s increasing involvement in the massive infrastructure development projects in neighbouring states as a threat not only to its security but also its economic interests. Indian leaders’ attitude is that Sri Lanka should remain exclusively within the sphere of influence of India.
 
 According to them, for foreign aid or assistance for economic development, there is no option for Sri Lanka other than relying upon India. In explaining why Sri Lanka should remain exclusively within the sphere of influence of India, the Prime Minister of India, in addressing the audience at the 14th UN International Vesak Celebrations, stressed the cultural bond and affinity between the peoples of India and Sri Lanka which make the peoples in these two countries inseparable. He said that therefore there is a moral obligation on the part of India to support Sri Lanka’s economic development efforts.
 
 The Prime Minister states that “India is committed to the economic prosperity of Sri Lanka’s citizens because whether it is on land or in the waters of the Indian Ocean, the security of our societies is indivisible”.
 
 What he means by stating that the security of our societies is indivisible is that India opposes Sri Lanka permitting China or any other outside power to involve in economic development activities, if such outside power’s involvement in strategically significant development projects poses a threat to India’s security, and as such, when Sri Lankan leaders seek the involvement of any outside power in Sri Lanka’s development activities, they should have India’s security concerns uppermost in their minds.
 
 Sri Lanka seeking India’s assistance for new projects
 
 When Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe met Prime Minister Modi in April, a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in economic development projects was signed.
 
 According to this Memorandum of Understanding, Sri Lanka seeks the cooperation of India for the construction of a regasified liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant, an LNG terminal and floating storage regasification unit in Colombo, and a solar power plant in Sampur. Several mega-development projects such as the creation of industrial zones or special economic zones in identified locations in Sri Lanka, a project for road connectivity and railway track upgrading and also a container terminal in Colombo, have been included in the MoU.
 
 However, the agreement between India and Sri Lanka for the development of the Oil Tank Farm, the proposed petroleum refinery and industrial zones in Trincomalee has become a controversial issue for the reason that there is a prejudice in the minds of some sections of the people in this country that India might use such facilities and assets in Sri Lanka for dominating Sri Lanka economically and also politically.
 
 Sri Lanka’s policy has been not to have an exclusive reliance on India or China for her economic development projects but to have the cooperation of both countries maintaining an equally cordial relationship. But, the geopolitical factor of Sri Lanka’s location in the Indian Ocean close to India and India’s security concerns is a very salient factor that foreign policy decision makers in Sri Lanka should take into consideration.
 
 Therefore, when Sri Lanka enters into agreements with other states seeking their involvement in strategically significant development projects, there should be very clear provisions in such agreements prohibiting such states from using Sri Lankan Soil, or in other words, any facilities or assets in Sri Lanka, for military purposes.","['projects', 'vistas', 'development', 'economic', 'fresh', 'lankan', 'foreign', 'lanka', 'china', 'india', 'sri', 'states', 'policy']","{'Australia': 1, 'Bhutan': 1, 'China': 25, 'India': 50, 'Japan': 3, 'Sri Lanka': 42, 'Myanmar': 1, 'Nepal': 1, 'Pakistan': 1, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

However, it is often conveniently ignored that it is the successive governments of Sri Lanka that actively sought Chinese investments. Therefore, it is important to examine why we sought Chinese investments in the first place.
 
 During the last decade, China has heavily invested in ports across the world. In South Asia, they built the Gwadar port in Pakistan and the Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka. China has been a forthcoming and non-interfering alternative to funding from international financial institutions and Western donors. They have the excess capital and the capacity to take high risks, and they financed the construction of the Hambantota Port at a time when no other country or development partner was willing to invest in it. Now a Chinese company has come forward to further invest in the Hambantota Port to develop it rather than let it squander its immense potential while generations of Sri Lankans serve the debts on a non-performing port. From an International Relations point of view, China also serves as a counter balance against the regional hegemony of India and other influences on Sri Lanka.
 
 Therefore, rather than solely criticize China for their opportunistic investments, it is important to recognize that it is our governments that have voluntarily and actively sought these investments and exercised their (our) will when they reached out to China to fund a massive port project among other infrastructure projects.
 
 An investor, a donor, and a trade partner
 
 Since the turn of the century, China’s exponential growth and increasing influence in many regions spanning Australia to South America have attracted the attention of the world. China has not spared South Asia in its unquenchable thirst for resources, search for strategic locations, and reach for emerging markets.
 
 According to the Heritage Foundation’s China Global Investment Tracker, from 2005 to 2014 China spent US$870.4 billion in worldwide investments and contracts, out of which US$8.9 billion was invested in Sri Lanka. In contrast, according to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is part of the World Bank group has made cumulative investments worth US$596 million in Sri Lanka.
 
 Even though Chinese investments in Sri Lanka are a small fraction compared to their global investments elsewhere, taken in context and compared to other global investors, these are considerable figures, and China’s investments in infrastructure are prominent.
 
 Chinese investments, grants, and trade are all intricately interlinked. In Sri Lanka, China is the biggest source of FDI pumping in more than US$400 million in 2014. China has been involved in projects such as the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, Mattala Airport, Katunayake Expressway, Moragahakanda Project, and the Southern Expressway.
 
 As the largest donor since 2009, China extended US$1.2 billion worth of assistance in the form of grants, loans, and credit amounting to 54% of the total US$2.2 billion committed by foreign countries and multilateral agencies. China provided Sri Lanka US$5 billion in aid over the last decade. Some of China’s lavish gifts to Sri Lanka include the BMICH, the Superior Courts complex, and the Lotus Pond (Nelum Pokuna) Performing Arts Theatre. China also fulfilled 65% of its total pledged assistance to Sri Lanka.
 
 China surpassed the United States as Sri Lanka’s second-largest trading partner behind India in 2013. In the same year, Sri Lanka’s bilateral trade with China exceeded US$3 billion. All these growing aid packages, trade relations, and investments indicate China’s increasing involvement in Sri Lanka and its lasting footprint in the region.
 
 From String of Pearls to One Belt One Road
 
 Foreign policy analysts have explained China’s expansion in South Asia with diverse arguments. The “string of pearls” theory examines the intention of China in building commercial and potential naval bases along the Indian Ocean region, including countries encircling India.
 
 Earlier this year, China turned the string of pearls theory propounded by the west on its head with the launch of One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative. With OBOR, China is building infrastructure connecting China, Asia, Europe, and Africa through ports, highways, railroads, pipelines, power and other networks.
 
 Unlike multilateral institutions and western countries, which impose conditionalities based on human rights, democracy, and good governance, when extending development loans, China does not interfere in the internal workings and sovereignty of loan/investment recipient countries.
 
 According to former Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Palitha Kohona, the Chinese government believes that low-key communication and mutually beneficial dialogue, carried out on an equal footing is more efficient than the US approach of distributing money and exerting pressure. According to Kohona, “Asians don’t go around teaching each other how to behave…there are ways we deal with each other - perhaps a quiet chat, but not wagging the finger.” His words clearly manifest one of the main reasons why Sri Lanka prefers China as a development partner.
 
 Sri Lanka becoming a middle-income country in 2012 also precluded concessionary loans and forced the country to find alternative sources of funding. Further, Western countries distanced themselves from Sri Lanka post 2009 based on war crimes allegations. During the tenure of President Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka moved away from its traditional funding partners and moved closer to China. Though the present government initially seemed to distance itself from China in 2015, soon it realized that the West does not have the kind of resources that China invests in Sri Lanka, and that China’s tentacles in Sri Lanka are too deep. Besides, in the new world order, China is too big a player to take for granted anyway.
 
 Unlike other donors who are reluctant to invest in large-scale, high-risk infrastructure projects, China is ‘forthcoming’. They are willing and able to take long term risks and invest in countries with higher political risk. During a 2010 interview with Singapore’s Straits Times, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said, “…take Hambantota Port. It was offered to India first. I was desperate for development work. But ultimately the Chinese agreed to build it.” Several large China-funded infrastructure projects in South Asia are high-risk ventures in which no other multilateral organisation or Western donor country wants to be involved in.
 
 China has also emerged as an expert in construction and engineering which has influenced many countries to choose China, particularly for port projects. All these have played a role in Sri Lanka choosing China’s involvement in building port infrastructure.
 
 A counter balance for India and external influences
 
 India has long seen itself as the natural leader in the Indian Ocean region and wants to ensure that its namesake ocean remains India’s Ocean. However, many countries consider that the Indian Ocean is not only India’s backyard but also a region to which both littoral states and outside powers have a claim. With increasingly strong ties with the US and aims to curb China’s expansion in the region, India threatens to become an ever-greater hegemon. Countries such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka are strengthening their ties with China to counterbalance the regional hegemony of India.
 
 China has also been a formidable friend to Sri Lanka in diverse international fora. In 2012, China was strongly against the US backed UN resolution against Sri Lanka. Though not openly admitted, when Sri Lanka reaches out to China to fund development projects, it is also driven by the fact that closer ties with China will be a way to balance power with India and prevent the influence or interference from other global players.
 
 Achieving long term development goals
 
 Chinese investments are also justified as a means to achieve long-term development goals in terms of infrastructure development, employment generation, and trade expansion. One of the main targets at the end of the war was to catch up on thirty years of lost development opportunities. China with its multi-million-dollar investments to put in place much-needed infrastructure became a dependable friend. When the Hambantota Port project was started, the then government claimed it would bring in prosperity to one of the least developed regions of the country, create job opportunities, and boost the economy.
 
 The recent agreement for Chinese investment in Hambantota is endorsed with expectations of skilled employment generation, regional and national economic development, stabilising the Sri Lankan rupee, and the reduction of national debt percentage. Further, better transport infrastructure will provide better access to regional markets.
 
 What’s in it for China?
 
 There are a number of strategic, political and economic reasons for China to be interested in the Indian Ocean region and South Asia in particular. Though a Chinese naval base in Sri Lanka is far-fetched, China is interested in maintaining its presence in the Indian Ocean because of its strategic, economic, and political importance.
 
 As the world’s leading manufacturing hub and the second largest economy, China needs to secure energy and goods supply routes along the Indian Ocean as alternatives to the Malacca strait. Located at the centre of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka is ideal for this and to refuel vessels and for crews to rest and recuperate.
 
 Further, these projects provide Chinese companies opportunities to engage in large-scale investments and earn revenue for decades. They provide employment opportunities for Chinese labourers and opportunities for Chinese companies to export machinery used in these projects. They boost China’s soft power strategies by creating a presence and by being a catalyst for development. The growing economy of Sri Lanka also provides a market, albeit small, for China’s manufactured goods.
 
 It is based on all those interests that China is making large-scale investments in maritime infrastructure in Sri Lanka and the region, and they insist that their investments are purely pacific and based on goodwill between long standing friends such as Sri Lanka.

 The Joint Opposition (JO) has already given a No Confidence motion in Parliament on Minister Karunanayake. However, the matter remains before the Presidential Commission on the Bond Scams, and any action by government will require the findings of the Commission.
 
 The JO and associated social-political forces are seeking to build a campaign against the government on an alleged ‘sale’ of the Hambantota Port or the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port to give its official name, to the Chinese, on what is a 99 year lease – with several provisions in the lease agreement that ensures Sri Lanka obtaining rights over the port and its facilities at various stages of the lease period.
 
 What is evident is that the JO, and the Rajapaksa clan that leads it, have realized that the lease of the Hambantota Port to the Chinese, and the development of the Port that will begin very soon, together with the Chinese business activity in the peripheral zone, will bring about a major change to the economic activity in the Hambantota District. The Rajapaksas were unable to bring about this, despite the huge projects it brought to Hambantota at considerable cost to the county, and not without financial advantages to those associated with these projects.
 
 Much of the Rajapaksa years of government from 2005 till 2014 saw strategies to show that Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family – the son, brothers and niece in Parliament and the Defence Secretary, were having a special campaign to develop the South of Sri Lanka, and particularly the Hambantota District that is the Deep South, to make it possibly the best developed region in the country.
 
 It is true that Hambantota remained a very poorly developed district in the country. The efforts by the late DM Rajapaksa to bring both political and economic development to the region in the 1930s failed, with his early demise. He was the person who brought the brown or ‘kurakkan’ coloured “sataka” to the political apparel of the time, which Mahinda Rajapaksa transferred to red and made it his own symbol of pro-people politics. But, the Hambantota Port, the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium – better known as the Sooriyawewa Stadium, and other lesser known projects, did little to improve the economy of the region and living conditions of the people. The huge sums paid for these key projects remained a burden on the national economy.
 
 The Mattala International Airport, that also carried the Mahinda Rajapaksa name, too was built by China at US $ 4.8 billion, mostly from soft loans obtained during the Rajapaksa Regime. The disastrous economic situation of this airport is best described by what it is known by the world aviation industry- the “World’s Emptiest International Airport”. The Sooriyawewa Stadium also did little to promote sports or help the Hambantota people by way of employment. In fact, it had been closed down and neglected until there was a sudden move by Sri Lanka Cricket to renovate it for a recent cricket series.
 
 With all the expenditure on the Rajapaksa Projects costing many billions of US dollars, to be paid up by the Sri Lankan economy and people, Hambantota was steadily transformed into an area of economic disaster in this country, with huge empty promises of emergent development mainly with Chinese funded projects. Hambantota possibly owed much more to the world than any other district in the rural areas of Sri Lanka. Had Mahinda Rajapaksa won the January 2015 Presidential Poll, Hambantota would inevitably have had to raise much more funds, again from the Chinese, who remained very close to Mahinda Rajapaksa and his regime.
 
 The situation in the district, the Southern Province and the county would have been much worse than today, and without the relief that has been brought by the Lease of the Hambantota Port, yes to the Chinese – the original builders who had the plans, the funds, the know-how and the interest to develop this port from the largely idling location it was till now, to a fully functioning international harbour.
 
 Benefits known
 
 The benefits of a port at Hambantota were known to economic planners and shipping interests in Sri Lanka for several decades. Several studies have been done to assess the value of a new port at Hambantota, considering the increased shipping in this region over the past few decades, and especially with the rise in importance of the Ports of Dubai and Singapore. Hambantota was certainly a much looked forward to location for fuelling and supply of victuals to the increasing numbers, in their hundreds, of vessels sailing in this part of the Indian Ocean, where Sri Lanka is strategically located. Apart from bringing glory to the Rajapaksa name, this growing need for a good port at Hambantota would have made Mahinda Rajapaksa look at this project. But, the hurries of political advantage certainly went against making it a fully functional port with the necessary bunkering and other essential facilities, when it was ceremonially opened.
 
 It is also necessary, in the context of international relations, to ensure that India, the closest neighbour of Sri Lanka is in no way given cause to be worried about the Chinese shipping and port activities in Hambantota. The Foreign Policy of Sri Lanka and the Policy of Good Neighbourly Relations should make sure that while China attends to the development and good, profitable functioning of the Hambantota Port, there will be no cause whatever, for concerns by India. The requirement in the lease with China that all security activities in the Hambantota Port will be handled by Sri Lanka is important in this context. There is also the decision to ensure that no foreign naval vessels will be allowed to this port and its facilities, with India having raised concerns about such vessels in Sri Lankan ports earlier.
 
 The lease of the Hambantota Port to China has certainly brought much international attention to Sri Lanka. The story is well focused by all international news agencies and, especially by the institutions related to investment and economic relations. There has been a welcome reaction by the international marketplace to the new development, and the promises it holds for the future. This is reflected in the Moody’s ‘Credit Positive’ image for Sri Lanka due to the port lease. This is what Moody’s said, as reported in Lanka Business Online (LBO) on August 01, 2017. Quote: The Hambantota port deal is credit positive for Sri Lanka because it will boost foreign-exchange reserves, which will ease the government’s external liquidity position ahead of several large international bond payments in 2019-22.
 
 “Earnings from the Hambantota Port stake sale will feed into the Central Bank’s foreign-exchange reserves, which will help bolster investor confidence and encourage future portfolio inflows, Moody’s said.
 
 “Importantly, the sale will allow the government to set aside earnings to repay its upcoming debt maturities and reduce its external debt, a key constraint on Sri Lanka’s credit quality. External debt maturities in 2019-22 total $13.8 billion.” Unquote
 
 In the context of the international interest on the Hambantota Port Lease, Forbes – Markets # Foreign Affairs, has given this opinion by Panos Mourdoukoutas on August 01, 2017.
 
 “China's Hambantota deal is bad news for both Pakistan and India”
 
 “The taking over of Hambantota by Beijing is bad news for both Pakistan and India -- for different reasons.
 
 For Pakistan, the deal will serve as a model for the future of CPEC (China–Pakistan Economic Corridor), a huge transportation network connecting China to the Arabian Sea at Pakistan’s Gwadar Port. Like Hambantota, CPEC started with loans that will eventually be converted into equity, as it seems very unlikely Pakistan will ever be in a position to pay them back. This means that Beijing will one day own CPEC, and collect tolls from every vehicle that makes use of it.
 
 For New Delhi, the Hambantota deal is bad news because it’s one more step to encircle and pacify India by Beijing. China’s enormous investment in CPEC, and port infrastructure in the Indian Ocean, serves much more than trade. It advances Beijing’s “String of Pearls” strategy, as well as its unofficial agenda to encircle India through its arch-rival, Pakistan.”
 
 To be fair, the Hambantota port will make it easier for India to trade with Sri Lanka. But it could also be used as a naval station for China should the two countries ever engage in a full-scale war.”
 
 These are certainly issues of importance that Sri Lanka’s political leaders and policy makers would have to always bear in mind with the progress of the “One Belt – One Road Policy of China, and India’s own development and defence strategies in the region.

 Introduction
 
 
 
 In Sept 2013, the Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a speech in Astana (the capital city of Kazakhstan and renamed as Nur-Sultan in 2019) calling for the building of a ‘modern’ “Silk Road Economic Belt”. However, the speech offered scant details about its intent, purpose and implementation imperatives. This is not unusual as the Chinese communist party is good at organising thoughts through discourses, information engineering and grandiose slogans.
 
 
 
 Without official clarity from the Chinese Government, the world’s media started to echo each other, resulting in One Belt One Road (OBOR) being everything to everyone; some even making the OBOR up as China’s Marshall Plan. As the Chinese were behind the curve in providing clarity to the OBOR vision, it resulted in the growth of multiple narratives, many of which were suspicious of China’s intent.
 
 
 
 Since 2016, OBOR has been referred to as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) although OBOR is still used by Chinese-language media. BRI project comprised of two components: the Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI) and the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB).
 
 
 
 Six years had passed since President Xi’s Astana speech. A bigger picture is emerging. Many projects, usually the larger ones, attracted international media spotlight; albeit not always the positive kind. Many more projects remained under-reported. Unfortunately, the deliberately all-encompassing nature of BRI meant that any and everything can indeed be classified as (or claims itself to be) a BRI project.
 
 In a sense, the BRI is like a painting in progress. It is a promising masterpiece on a blank canvas. Many painters are keen and they do not always agree on the final picture nor do they know what the others have in mind. The Chinese Government calls the initiative “a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future”. The purpose is “to construct a unified large market and make full use of both international and domestic markets, through cultural exchange and integration, to enhance mutual understanding and trust of member nations, ending up in an innovative pattern with capital inflows, talent pool and technology database”

Many painters are keen and they do not always agree on the final picture nor do they know what the others have in mind. The Chinese Government calls the initiative “a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future”. The purpose is “to construct a unified large market and make full use of both international and domestic markets, through cultural exchange and integration, to enhance mutual understanding and trust of member nations, ending up in an innovative pattern with capital inflows, talent pool and technology database”. The initiative has a targeted completion date of 2049 which coincides with the 100th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China (PRC).
 
 
 
 The aim of this article is to present a historical geopolitical framework on BRI in an attempt to peek through the veneer of slogans for possible strategic intent.
 
 Geopolitical framework: Heartland Theory and influence of Sea Power Theory
 
 
 
 Sir Halford Mackinder explained the Heartland Theory in ‘The Geographical Pivot of History’ in 1904. The theory posited that whichever nation controlled Eastern Europe would control the Heartland (the core of Eurasia); subsequently this nation would then control the World Island (all of Europe and Asia); and finally, would dominate the world.
 
 
 
 Alfred Thayer Mahan’s view on sea power was focused upon the oceans. Simply, whoever conquered the seas would control the world.
 
 
 
 Both theories have proven true throughout history, but not at the same time with the same nation. The partnership of Mackinder’s and Mahan’s theories are found within the China’s BRI project.
 
 Halford Mackinder
 
 
 
 Halford John MacKinder presented his Heartland Theory to the Royal Geographical Society entitled ‘The Geographical Pivot of History’ in 1904. It was later expanded and explained in more detail in his book, ‘Democratic Ideals and Reality: A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction’ published in 1919.
 
 
 
 Mackinder argued on the importance of the Eurasian landmass that largely consisted of Russia, the Himalayan region and parts of China. According to MacKinder, the Heartland stretched from the Volga to the Yangtze and from the Himalayas to the Artic. Mackinder saw the importance of the land routes being revived by the building of railway lines and the interconnections it entailed. He opined that the land with its vast resources combined with a network of modern railway lines will be strategically important.
 
 
 
 Mackinder stated his famous maxim: “Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island; who rules the World-Island commands the world.” The World-Island comprised Afro-Eurasia i.e. the inter-linked continents of Europe, Asia and Africa. It controlled well over 50% of the world’s resources largest, the most populous and richest of all possible land combinations. In sum, Mackinder saw that the main pivot in global power and influence will come from the Heartland and warned on the dangers of Russia (at that point in time) remerging as a great power after its setback in the Russo-Japanese war or an European or Asian power taking hold of Russia’s vast land space.
 
 
 
 China’s BRI will create a new Heartland that will consist of the large landmass of China and Central Asia with parts of Eastern and Western Europe, a geographical location similar with Mackinder’s original landmass but without Russia. If successful, BRI will create a new fulcrum of power that will have strong influence over a large Eurasian continental area and will provide China with immense economic benefits and security of strategic interests.
 
 Alfred Thayer Mahan
 
 
 
 Alfred Thayer Mahan, a prominent theorist on sea-power encapsulated his ideas in his classic book, ‘The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660-1783’ published in 1890. Mahan’s thoughts were written in a period in which he believed that the United States should build a formidable navy and expand its maritime capabilities to be a major sea-power that could mirror Great Britain’s power and possessions in the world, which Mahan thought was gained through its dominant maritime power. Mahan also suggested that in order to support a naval and merchant fleet, an aspiring sea-power should gain land possessions to support its maritime fleet’s logistical needs – for example coaling stations and harbour facilities to resupply and repair its maritime fleet. These land possessions will also serve as forward strategic bases.
 
 
 
 Mahan’s core tenets were that since seas act as a highway and are a common resource for all states, there is great importance in controlling them especially the sea lines of communications (SLOCs) which encompass supply lines. Control of the seas will allow a state to grow and extend both its power and wealth, by exploiting commerce and subsequent trade routes during peacetimes on one hand; and by exploiting the seas for military purposes during times of war on the other hand.
 
 
 
 Mahan’s maritime and geopolitical ideas are not original though as it had been well practiced by some of the more successful ancient civilisations and empires except he was the first to codify and write it down in a book.
 
 
 
 China has vast areas with ocean frontage. Some of its most developed cities are located in the eastern areas of China that are serviced with a network of ports. China’s trade today relies significantly on sea-lanes and maritime logistics. China’s obsession with the South China Sea and the claiming of islands as well as building of a series of ‘permanent aircraft carriers’ in the South China Sea (artificial islands) points to a strong Mahanian influence.
 
 
 
 The maritime component of BRI which includes the South China Sea, the Strait of Malacca, Indian Ocean, Gulf of Aden, through the Suez Canal and into the Mediterranean Sea is quite similar to the large oceanic areas that were visited by China’s Admiral Zheng He’s treasure fleets (except the Mediterranean Sea) in a series of seven expeditions during the early 15th century. China then had the world’s largest naval fleet and had used it to expand its influence and trade via the Asian maritime lanes of communication.
 
 
 
 The BRI sea-route will also involve large co-development of ports and maritime support centres in Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Djibouti, Greece and Italy. This vast network of ports will support China’s future growth as a maritime power – first to support its merchant fleet and then later its blue water navy.
 
 
 
 China’s investment in the BRI’s maritime sphere will prepare the necessary logistical support bases to sustain its future naval strategy and strategic interests which Mahan had pointed out as one of the key variables in ensuring the capability to project and sustaining a nation’s maritime power and extending its geopolitical presence in the world.
 
 Conclusion
 
 
 
 The combination of Mackinder and Mahan geopolitical and strategic thoughts provide a plausible interpretation regarding China’s BRI strategic intent. If successful, China will ‘rule the Heartland’ together with the ‘command of the seas’, both vital to its strategic and geographical contexts.
 
 
 
 The implications of BRI for Sri Lanka will be presented in another instalment as we study the ‘Two-Ocean’ Strategy. The Two-Ocean Strategy began to appear in the literature around 2005 as a pre-conceptualised project set by the Communist Party of China (CPC) and representing a strategic objective to achieve. The narrative behind this is that China ought to gain back control of the waters surrounding it as a symbolic end to its “Century of Humiliation” as well as to modernise its own navy since the country’s economic ascension. The implementation of the BRI will provide the Two-Ocean Strategy with renewed relevance and momentum. As Sri Lanka is a key player in the maritime component of BRI, it is imperative to seek a way to harness its geopolitical importance to bring about growth and prosperity to the land and its people.

 Over the last few years, both economic and historical ties between Sri Lanka and China have grown with China becoming a significant economic partner of Sri Lanka. The Belt and Road initiative (BRI) is at the centre of this. The Chinese Government has invested large sums to develop infrastructure and trade routes for what it believes is a mutually-beneficial program.
 
 
 
 BRI has five key objectives, namely, policy coordination, connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds. However, one of the primary challenges the initiative has faced includes obtaining the support and cooperation of other emerging economies, mainly India. Western powers also remain sceptical of the initiative and view it as means of China increasing its geopolitical power and influence.
 
 
 
 
 
 Belt and Road Initiatives in Sri Lanka
 
 
 
 
 
 The BRI program is split between two main initiatives – a revitalised land route between China and Europe via Russia or the ‘Silk Road Economic Belt’ (the Belt), and the ‘Maritime Silk Road’ (the Road), which aims to connect a multitude of countries via new sea routes and infrastructure. Sri Lanka’s involvement has largely been with the latter of these initiatives given its geographical location in the middle of the Indian Ocean, with an emphasis on Sri Lanka becoming a hub facilitating easy transit of goods from China to Sri Lanka and other Southeast Asian economies and beyond.
 
 
 
 To this effect, the majority of BRI investments in Sri Lanka have been to facilitate this maritime effort and a number of major infrastructure projects have been kicked off. Under the BRI project, Sri Lanka has currently secured up to $ 8 billion of financing from China.
 
 
 
 The CIFC, formerly known as the Colombo Port City, is an instrumental part of China’s BRI and aims to aims to build a new city and financial centre along the existing Colombo coastline that will serve as Sri Lanka’s financial and business district by 2030. Another important initiative is the Hambantota Port and adjoining industrial estate.
 
 
 
 Sri Lanka is located at a strategic point for the BRI. The Port of Hambantota is indispensable for China’s energy security because the country imports two-thirds of its oil through shipping lanes south of the port. This initiative was aimed to build a secondary port at the coastal town of Hambantota, to alleviate capacity and crowding concerns with the primary port in Colombo.
 
 
 
 In addition to this, the latest investment gives China control over 15,000 acres of land adjacent to the port for the development of an industrial zone in Hambantota. The feasibility study for the industrial park identified the development of shipping services, processing of seafood, agricultural products and other processing/manufactured industries as potential ventures. Another BRI project in Sri Lanka is the expansion and modernisation of the Colombo Port – the Colombo International Container Terminal, a Sino-Sri Lanka joint venture.
 
 
 
 In addition to seaports, China has also funded the construction of airports. The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) is located in Hambantota, 241 km south-east of Sri Lanka’s capital city, Colombo. The MRIA is the second international airport in Sri Lanka.
 
 Implications of BRI for Sri Lanka
 
 BRI holds out the prospect of helping to bridge the significant infrastructure financing gap, increase connectivity, link local markets to regional and global value chains, and thereby increase trade and investment in the participating countries.
 
 
 
 Higher trade flows can be one of the important gains. As the world’s second- largest economy, China is one of the biggest traders in the world. While Sri Lanka is not an important trading partner of China, China has emerged to become Sri Lanka’s second largest trading partner after India, in terms of Sri Lanka’s total trade with the world. Initiatives, such as the BRI will enhance trade routes between both countries and facilitate trade bilaterally and beyond.
 
 
 
 Attracting more FDI can be a big gain, which remains a priority for Sri Lanka. As part of the BRI, there have been significant Chinese investments in Sri Lanka already. Existing investments in Sri Lanka as part of the BRI amount to approximately $ 8 billion, while China has offered up to an additional $ 24 billion in financing.
 
 
 
 For countries needing infrastructure, the BRI holds the promise of investment in new railways, roads, ports and other projects, improving connectivity within and between countries. However, making success of the BRI will require more than just building physical infrastructure. Soft infrastructure is critical, which means facilitating the movement of people, goods and services across borders.
 
 
 
 However, navigating power rivalries and geopolitics will be more challenging. Currently, Sri Lanka is walking a tight rope, seeking economic and other benefits from China under the BRI while maintaining close relations with its rivals, the US, Japan and India. The BRI has raised concerns of China’s intentions in the Indian Ocean given the ambitions of the plan. Not surprisingly, India is not a party to the BRI.
 
 
 
 The implications of the BRI for a country’s autonomy and sovereignty are matters of concern as well. With a significant portion of investment and funding in BRI coming from Chinese public entities, there is concern that a growing debt burden can lead to weaker negotiating strength and loss of sovereignty.
 
 
 
 With the ownership of key central infrastructure (e.g. the ports) being tied to such entities, Sri Lanka sacrifices a level of autonomy around how to manage this infrastructure. Indeed, China’s takeover of the troubled Hambantota port has raised questions about loss of sovereignty arising from large debt-to-equity swap arrangements.

 “They would like to talk about opportunities to invest and build certain factories in Montenegro — mainly focusing on wood and food industry. Their model would be to build a factory in Montenegro which would export the products to China.” Since Bar and Shanghai are sister cities, Montenegrins think that that fact alone would be enough for the two countries to build stronger bonds through setting up a direct airline link, but also through organizing a joint economic forum which should be held sometime next year. Hadžić also noted that the Chinese are ready to help Montenegrin wood and food producers financially by offering them lucrative loan deals. At the moment, the Chinese have only one active business deal in Montenegro — they are importing 5 million bottles of wine per year from “Plantaže AD”.
 
 Hadžić said that Montenegro should not look further and should choose China as their main business partner. “China is the world’s biggest economy and having them as our partner would be amazing. It is a very structurally polished country where institutions are highly respected and, most importantly, they like our country.” Another field where the Chinese would like to collaborate with Montenegro is education — that’s why a few professors and managers from universities from China are coming as a part of the delegation. They will visit a few Montenegrin universities and colleges and offer a student and professor exchange program.","['delegation', 'universities', 'build', 'chinese', 'coming', 'talk', 'china', 'partner', 'business', 'wood', 'montenegro', 'montenegrin']","{'China': 5, 'Montenegro': 6}",,,,,

 Beijing, China (15 May 2017) – Minister of Economy Dragica Sekulić signed yesterday the Memorandum of understanding between the governments of Montenegro and China within the framework of Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st century Maritime Silk Road Initiative.
 
 Minister of Economy Dragica Sekulić and Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission of China He Lifeng signed the memorandum aimed at implementing the ""Belt and Road“ initiative and promoting cooperation between the two countries.
 
 Having in mind the established political consensus between Montenegro and China to promote the “Belt and Road” initiatives, the parties under this memorandum will join forces to create synergy between the “Belt and Road” initiative and national development strategies in order to improve coordination of policies and boost cooperation for peaceful development and common prosperity of both countries.
 
 This Initiative will help the two countries boost cooperation and reach goals set out within this framework, thus creating an opportunity for exchanging experience and development of exchange programmes. The parties under this memorandum are set to intensify cooperation, boost ties and joint efforts towards establishing economic corridors and promoting development of the region.
 
 At the opening of the forum, President of China Xi Jinping made opening remarks regarding the importance of the Silk Road, stressing that the initiative is widening horizons and chances for prosperity. “Belt and Road” initiative has invested 4 billion dollars so far, President Jinping highlighted, adding that the idea is to pursue this good trend in the coming period. He also explained that the China’s banking system will develop new forms of loans aimed at helping countries engaged in the initiative reach funds for investment projects. In the next three years, China will provide 3 billion yuan to the developing countries which are members of the Initiative, he pointed out.","['initiative', 'beijing', 'countries', 'understanding', 'silk', 'belt', 'development', 'memorandum', 'cooperation', 'china', 'sign', 'road', 'montenegro']","{'China': 8, 'Montenegro': 3}",,,,,

 “I believe that, if our two parties go together, in synergy, in the same direction, we will certainly overcome the difficulties and finish this historical project perfectly,” Liu told Mina-business agency.
 
 He said that China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) and its subsidiary China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which were involved in the construction of the priority motorway section between Smokovac and Matesevo, were internationally recognized companies in the field of integrated infrastructure, with experience in the implementation of a large number of notable projects.
 
 Liu said the motorway construction project played the role of an “admiral ship” in the relations between China and Montenegro, attracting a great attention of both governments and nations.
 
 “The project also conveys the best wishes of Chinese-Montenegrin friendship and cooperation. I have been following this project consistently since I come to Montenegro, and I am happy to see that China and Montenegro have joined efforts to make sure that it has been finalized in the best way,” said Liu.
 
 He said that China encouraged the CRBC and other Chinese companies to seek as many cooperation opportunities as possible and participate in the economic and social development of Montenegro.
 
 “At the same time, we expect from Montenegro to provide good business environment,” said Liu.
 
 He said that the cooperation between the two countries had improved in the previous several years, adding that Chinese companies expressed interest in the infrastructure, power plant development and the Smart City project.
 
 Talking about the interest of Chinese tourists, Liu said that 40,000 of them had visited Montenegro last year, twice as many as in 2017.

 The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar announced on January 10 that President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to Myanmar this week to sign infrastructure and investment agreements and celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral ties.
 
 Xi’s visit on January 17-18 will be his first in his current capacity. He is scheduled to meet with President Win Myint as well as Myanmar’s de facto leader, State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper quoted ambassador to Myanmar Chen Hai as saying on Sunday.
 
 President Xi plans to use the visit to build up contact with different stakeholders, including Commander-in-Chief of Defense Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and parliamentary and party leaders.
 
 With 2020 marking the 70th anniversary of mutual diplomatic recognition, Xi’s visit is expected to bolster bilateral ties. He is also expected to push for investment and infrastructure projects including the Myitsone Dam, China-Myanmar Economic Corridor scheme and other projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
 
 From oil pipelines linking Kyaukphyu in Rakhine State to Kunming in the Chinese province of Yunnan to a deep-water port leading to the Indian Ocean, China has sought to expand its ambitions to a region with constant armed conflicts.
 
 Despite the challenges, during Xi’s two-day visit the two countries are expected to sign a $1.3 million deal on the Kyaukphyu deep-sea port, which is strategically and economically fundamental to stepping up the development of China’s inland provinces. Part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the project also includes a special economic zone along with the port.
 
 The Myanmar government signed a framework agreement with China’s state-owned consortium CITIC group in November 2018, but it fell short of a concession-granting accord.
 
 Deputy Commerce Minister U Aung Htoo told reporters in Naypyidaw that there are seven agreements under the accord, two of which will be signed during Xi’s visit. He added that other memoranda of understanding will also be signed, including on exports of crops and cattle.
 
 On Sunday, the State Counselor made a rare trip to the northern Kachin State close to the China border, where the $3.6 billion Myitsone Dam project was suspended in 2011 due to widespread opposition.
 
 She did not mention the dam, while China’s vice foreign minister Luo Zhaohui said at a press conference last Friday that both countries were “still maintaining close communication” on the project.
 
 China is the largest foreign investor in Myanmar. Approved Chinese investments from 1988 to October 30, 2019 amounted to nearly $21 billion.","['visit', 'state', 'highlights', 'chinese', 'milestone', 'xis', 'diplomatic', 'agreements', 'infrastructure', 'chinas', 'including', 'dam', 'signed', 'myanmar', 'expected']","{'China': 9, 'India': 1, 'Myanmar': 7}",,,,,
451,Myanmar Business Today,https://mmbiztoday.com/2-9-b-myanmar-refinery-deal-key-for-guangdong-zhenrong-energy/,0,,Myanmar,E,2015-02-20 12:41:23,$2.9-b Myanmar Refinery Deal Key for Guangdong Zhenrong Energy,"Guangdong Zhenrong Energy Co, a major Chinese bulk commodity trader, expects the country’s “One Belt One Road” strategy to help boost its overseas investments, which in its case includes a planned massive oil refinery in Myanmar.
 
 The country’s New Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road strategies were launched in 2013 to further open up to the rest of the world and speed up infrastructure connectivity in the region.
 
 The proposed Myanmar refinery, with an expected annual processing capacity of 5 million tonnes of crude oil, has been submitted by the Guangdong provincial government to the State Council under the strategy, said Cui Yi, director general of Zhenrong Energy’s refining and petrochemical department.
 
 He said the company also expects to benefit from policies within the strategy to develop other overseas petrochemical industrial parks.
 
 Zhenrong Energy received the go-ahead for the $2.9 billion Myanmar project from the National Development and Reform Commission in November and is currently applying for state approval from the authorities in Myanmar.
 
 Myanmar’s laws on foreign investment were amended in August last year and now require participation in any new petrochemical project by its own Ministry of Energy. Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd and Myanmar’s Htoo Group of Companies are already joint venture partners in the project.
 
 Located in the Dawei special economic zone in southern Myanmar, the complex will become the largest refinery in the country when completed, Cui said, and is expected to play a key part in the raising of professional standards in the country’s petrochemicals industry.
 
 Its facilities will include the construction of a 150,000-tonne crude oil dock, two refined oil docks, warehousing and logistics facilities, a power plant, and a network of gas, and liquefied petroleum gas stations.
 
 Products from the refinery will mainly satisfy the Myanmar market, with the surplus to be exported.
 
 Cui said the refinery’s plans date back to 2009 when Zhenrong Energy’s Chairman Xiong Shaohui first learned how the country’s refining technology had remained low. Myanmar still imports more than 80 percent of the refined oil products it needs.
 
 A memorandum of understanding on the project was signed the following year with an environmental assessment then carried out in 2012, a year before the country’s environmental protection law was passed.
 
 The refinery is expected to adopt China’s national IV environmental standards, the equivalent of the Euro IV standard, Cui said.
 
 To assure local people about its environmental commitment to the project, the company invited a group of around 30 Myanmar villagers, monks and journalists to tour an oil refinery in Luoyang, Henan province, and oil exporting facilities in Guangdong in 2013.
 
 In May last year, 1,370 villagers signed a letter in support of the refinery project, which was handed in to the country’s president’s office, the energy ministry and local governments.
 
 “Although the investment environment in Myanmar has appeared to be unstable over the past two years – which slowed the pace by some investors – the reform and opening-up in Myanmar is accelerating,” Cui said.
 
 “The market is underdeveloped but still has a positive outlook and offers considerable opportunities. Although some risks exist, it is attracting increasing numbers of foreign investors.”
 
 Xiao Yaofei, a professor with the School of Economics and Trade, Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, said China’s “One Belt One Road” strategy, which is emphasising future infrastructure connectivity with various countries, is expected to lay the foundations for foreign investment by Chinese firms.
 
 Xiao said Zhenrong Energy’s Myanmar project should also pave the way for other petrochemical-related investments by other Chinese firms, such as those engaged in chemicals manufacturing, for instance, and its support industries.
 
 Founded in 2002, Zhenrong Energy generated 105.2 billion yuan ($16.8 billion) in revenue in 2013, including 65.2 billion yuan from international trade, ranking 139 among the top 500 Chinese companies. It is jointly owned by the State-owned Zhuhai Zhenrong Corp, one of the country’s largest oil traders.
 
 As the global refined oil trading sector becomes increasingly competitive, the company has placed overseas investment at its core and aims to become one of the world’s top 500 multinationals in the next three to five years.

452,Myanmar Business Today,https://mmbiztoday.com/india-sri-lanka-china-relations-building-bridges-via-infrastructure/,0,,Myanmar,E,2015-03-02 02:25:31,India – Sri Lanka – China Relations: Building Bridges via Infrastructure,"Sri Lanka’s President Maithripala Sirisena visited India last month, in his first state visit abroad. In a recent speech he declared, “In considering the past, we make a clear commitment towards following a foreign policy of the middle path, in friendship with all nations.” This signals that the new Sri Lankan government seeks to repair relations with New Delhi which soured under the previous government. President Sirisena’s visit follows close on the heels of his decision to review of all Chinese infrastructure projects awarded under Rajapaksa, his predecessor.
 
 How do Indian infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka pan out in comparison to Chinese ventures? What is the significance of the Hambantota project for Sri Lanka and the world economy? What were the implications of the visit for India–Sri Lanka relations?
 
 Runway of Indian grants and Chinese loans
 
 Sri Lanka has invested heavily in infrastructure since the civil war ended in 2009. Enormous attention is being paid to the tentative plan of China developing the Hambantota port. However there is not enough spotlight being shed on India’s infrastructure projects in the island nation. One area where many projects are located is the once war torn Jaffna district. The irony lies in the fact that the once war affected districts which India is helping to rebuild were attacked by a defense force partly supplied by Beijing. In the present day, China denies claims of a military maneuver behind its Sri Lankan forays, but the docking of PLA-Navy submarines at Colombo does not allay India’s fears. On the other hand, it is evident that the Indian ventures are being carried out to rebuild the civilian fabric of Sri Lanka’s socio-economy.
 
 Palaly airport in Sri Lanka’s northern Jaffna district will be developed as a civilian airport with Indian cooperation. This is despite Palaly being an important site for military aircraft. It reflects the commitment of India to repair the civilian economy of the island nation. Palaly being a crucial connecting point between Jaffna and the rest of the country, demonstrates that India is eager to lock in peaceful reconciliation via infrastructure links among all sections of the country. Another instance of Indian benevolence is the now fully operational Colombo-Matara rail link, which was destroyed by the tsunami. It was rebuilt and upgraded by an India under a $167.4 million concessional line of credit. It is to be noted that Matara is a major commercial hub in Sri Lanka, and thus has gained by India’s aid. Interestingly, Matara will be linked to Hambantota by a rail line partly funded by Chinese loans. Thus Indian and Chinese infrastructure ambitions in Sri Lanka are converging at a common point of interest. It remains to be seen if the future holds joint cooperation between Delhi and Beijing in developing Sri Lanka’s infrastructural economy.
 
 Another important project that India is involved in the renovation of the Kankesanthurai Harbour in northern Jaffna district, which acts as a Sri Lankan naval base. It is clear that India is only interested in economic prospects for the same, as part of its line of credit of $382.37 million is being utilised for the track laying on the railway line to connect Kankesanthurai with Pallai, another coastal town. Besides, India has no strategic reason or need to dock its naval vessels at the renovated harbour, as the subcontinent state already possess the expertise and logistics required.
 
 It is also significant that many of the Indian infrastructure-building and renovation projects in Sri Lanka are sponsored via grants. On the other hand China is also cooperating in civilian projects but mostly through hefty long term loans. These include the $292 million funded Colombo Port highway, the Lakvijaya coal power plant funded with $455 million from China’s Exim Bank, and the $350 million funded South Container Terminal at Colombo. The scale of the projects has generated anxiety in Delhi over a looming Chinese stronghold in the isle. India is not the only party with apprehension. The newly elected Sirisena government too has displayed concern over growing Chinese influence and especially the allegations of corruption during the Rajapaksa regime. Nevertheless these fears do not mean the projects under review will be scrapped. For instance on February 7, Prime Minister Ranil Wikremesinghe announced that the feasibility of the China-funded port city in Colombo is to be studied. Similarly, the Hambantota project could have immense prospects for Sri Lanka, and India may learn to accept it as a crucial part of the Sri Lankan economy.
 
 A vital transit point
 
 The Hambantota port project will capture a share of the lucrative shipping lanes west of Malacca and east of Suez. Named the Magam Rahunapura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port, it is a deep sea bunkering, logistics and industrial facility under construction on Sri Lanka’s southern coast, and will define the trajectory of the nation’s postwar economy. Its first phase being built at a cost of $361 million, with 85 percent being loaned by China, it will also be one of the strategic gateways lining China’s vision of a Maritime Silk Route. Thus it has potential to transform the Sri Lankan status on the global maritime shipping map. There are interestingly a few advantages for India as well. As 70 percent of shipping to and from Indian ports is handled by Colombo, the Hambantota port complex can ease pressures on Colombo. India also depends on the adjoining maritime territory for its energy needs. The sea lanes a few miles south of Hambantota are used for about 50 percent of India’s energy supplies.
 
 China too gains as 80 percent of its oil supplies pass through this route. The economic significance of the Hambantota project has ripples across the globe in other states as well, especially in Southeast Asia. It is thus no surprise that the deep water is not a sole Chinese entry. It is a multilateral effort in which investors from Singapore, Hong Kong and US are also joining the Chinese investors. Promoting multinational investment, particularly with US involvement, makes China’s activities less susceptible to criticism from Indian and American analysts who fear the rise of China in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka’s new government may be tilting towards India, but it is clear that it still needs Beijing’s help to develop its ambitious economy.
 
 Looking towards new destinations
 
 India has much to gain politically, strategically and economically from President Sirisena’s visit. It will help cement once wavering ties and consolidate India- Sri Lanka relations at a new level. An acceptable balance of power can be created between Sri Lanka’s two giant partners. While China forays into Hambantota, Sri Lanka must reassure India that the project will remain a commercial venture. On the other hand, India can continue to hold strong ties based on its presence in Trincomalee on Sri Lanka’s eastern coast. Coast Guard maritime exercises were carried out between India, Sri Lanka and Maldives here. But there is significance beyond strategic concerns in this port city, given its nature as an energy hub.
 
 As Shiv Shankar Menon had stated, given the need for energy security, it is natural that Indian companies would operate oil tank farms in Trincomalee in Sri Lanka. In fact one reason why India sent its military to Sri Lanka in 1987 was reportedly to prevent Trincomalee Harbour from falling into the hands of Western powers, especially the US. There is immense potential in this region for India to establish its interests. In 2013, the Indian Oil Company announced it would invest $40 million to refurbish about 30 oil tanks at this eastern port city. Interestingly soon after India voted against Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Commission over its alleged rights violations, Rajapaksa’s regime announced it would take over tanks not being used by Lanka IOC. It remains to be seen how the new government will handle this turbulence. It is encouraging to observe that IOC is considering setting up its first refinery outside India in Sri Lanka.
 
 Hence it is observed that there is potential for a balance to be created between Indian and Chinese presence in Sri Lanka. Amiable relations must continue with Beijing, while ensuring that Indian interests are also prioritised. From this trilateral relation, a new powerhouse of economic and strategic potential can emerge. All three countries can thus share a mutually beneficial relationship while flying into the horizon of the Asian century.

 Myanmar and China signed a flurry of infrastructure accords shoring up three main projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during President Xi Jinping’s visit on January 17-18.
 
 The 33 agreements signed by Xi and State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi include a concession agreement and shareholders’ agreement on a deep-water port in Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone, one of the projects the Chinese president has called the “three pillars” of China-Myanmar Economic Corridor. The other two are China-Myanmar Border Economic Cooperation Zone (CMEC) and the New Yangon City.
 
 Kyaukphyu SEZ
 
 China has long relied on the Strait of Malacca, a vital trade route and major oil choke point, for the bulk of its oil and gas shipments. Linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the strait serves as the shortest sea route between the Middle East and Asia. But it is narrow as well as strategically vulnerable, forcing China to seek alternative routes in order to ensure its energy supply.
 
 The $2.7 billion Kyaukphyu SEZ, located in the conflict-riven Rakhine State, covers a deep-water port along the Bay of Bengal, offering China a bypass route from the southern province of Yunnan to the Indian Ocean.
 
 Kyaukphyu already serves as one of China’s oil and gas sources. The China-Myanmar oil and gas pipelines, established in 2013, transported 10.8 million tons of Myanmar crude oil to China in 2019, up 6.3 percent year-on-year, China’s state-run news agency China.org.cn reported quoting figures from the Kunming Customs in Yunnan province.
 
 China-Myanmar Border Economic Cooperation Zone
 
 As part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding in 2018 on the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor. The CMEC stretches from China’s landlocked Yunnan province to Mandalay in central Myanmar, further connecting to Yangon in the south and Kyaukphyu SEZ in the western Rakhine State.
 
 The corridor, consisting of highways, railways, an economic zone and other infrastructure projects, is embroiled in the ongoing conflicts between the government and ethnic armed groups in northern and western Myanmar. Heightening environmental concerns over China’s infrastructure projects also triggered oppositions from locals, and as a result, the $3.6 billion Myitsone Dam project has sat in limbo since 2011.
 
 In an article published by the China Dialogue, an independent environment news agency based in Beijing and London, Nicholas Lo, a US-based forestry and environmental researcher, criticized the Chinese BRI investment in northern Myanmar.
 
 Lo cited as an example the plantation problems in Kachin state. While Myanmar timber has entered the Chinese market illegally, Chinese-run banana plantations in Kachin State have increased from 2,500 hectares in 2007 to over 40,500 hectares in 2018, according to civil society and government reports. Use of insecticides on the plantations has caused pollution of water supplies, damaged soil and killed fish and livestock.
 
 “A green BRI will need more than economic investment alone,” Lo said. “Given the de facto absence of functioning regulation or any guarantees for local communities’ livelihoods in northern Myanmar, Chinese investment capital thus far has facilitated the degradation of the border region’s ecologically and culturally diverse landscapes.”
 
 The researcher urged, “A broader and more inclusive coalition of stakeholders, particularly grassroots civil society groups that are most attuned to the needs of local communities, must be involved in development planning and decision-making processes for Myanmar’s border regions.”
 
 Other Agreements
 
 New Yangon City, an urban development project proposing to build a new industrial area in Myanmar’s largest city, is envisioned to be a “productive” and “liveable” city with “world-class infrastructure”.
 
 Despite the proposal and endorsement from the Chinese state-owned construction firm China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), a government official familiar with the accord told the Financial Times that some of the “key bidding, financing and other details” have not been finalized.
 
 As no new projects were signed during the visit, observers said Myanmar is cautious of projects with China.
 
 “I strongly believe that Myanmar is now very conscious in developing projects with China. The previous governments were criticized by many for projects like the Myitsone Dam for being too easy in contracting the projects to China,” said Sai Khaing Myo Tun, an associate professor of international relations at Yangon University of Foreign Language.
 
 “People want win-win projects and those that will not have negative impacts on the environment,” he added.

 Since Thailand is also an early BRI backer and one of its recipients, increased attention has begun to focus on its marathon negotiations with China over the US$12 billion (K18.2 trillion) high-speed railway project, which began with much fanfare at the end of 2015. China watchers are eager to know what challenges and prospects both sides faced over the past four years with their unsettling deal and ever-changing criteria.
 
 
 
 
 
 Are there lessons to be drawn from the Sino-Thai negotiations? From the beginning, repeated criticism has been heaped on China’s continent-wide BRI. Among key allegations was the toxic “debt trap” for recipient countries and Beijing’s desire to expand its geopolitical influence to challenge the West. Examples from Africa and South Asia were highlighted as the BRI’s dark side.
 
 Before the current deal, previous Thai governments under Abhisit Vejjajiva and Yingluck Shinawatra signed several memoranda of understanding to improve connectivity and infrastructure. However, back in 2015, nobody in Thailand would have thought for a minute that the country’s largest ever deal would drag on this long, given the excellent Sino-Thai ties. From the start, it was supposed to be a wholly China-owned project, like the numerous deals that Beijing had successfully completed in other countries. As the bilateral negotiations deepened, domestic opposition grew stronger, targeting the lack of transparency and shared benefits, forcing Prayut Chan-ocha’s government to retreat. Forceful voices from some academic circles also argued that the country’s bargaining power had been compromised due to the government’s decision to pick China as the investor to transform Thailand into ASEAN’s transportation hub.
 
 Then, new ideas and plans emerged, forcing both sides to consider a joint venture plan. After several rounds of negotiations, they still could not agree on the size of their investment and shared risks. To save the deal and appease local stakeholders, Thailand then decided to take on the whole project so that it could have more say in the overall design and benefits, especially the environmental impact assessments.
 
 At this juncture, one could easily argue that the high comfort level between Thai and Chinese negotiators permits both sides the luxury of working on the project’s nitty-gritty details, which will link the Northeast and Central Thailand with Laos and China’s high-speed train network. After nearly 30 rounds of negotiations, Thailand and China still have not signed the final contract on the multiple-phase, 873-kilometre railway that was supposed to begin in 2016 and be completed in three years.
 
 
 
 
 
 Truth be told, if such negotiations had taken place between anyone other than China and Thailand, the whole deal would have collapsed in no time. Other recipients would have yielded to China’s pressure and time-consuming negotiating process. Malaysia’s recent decision to continue its Eastern Coast Rail Link after some serious budget and route revisions demonstrates the dedicated nature of bilateral agreements on mega-infrastructure projects, which involve huge loans and workforces. Malaysia’s former prime minister Najib Razak was the BRI’s most enthusiastic supporter among ASEAN leaders, signing up for more than two dozen projects.
 
 Elsewhere in the region, China and Myanmar are trying to renegotiate the $3.6 billion Myitsone Dam project in Kachin State, which was unceremoniously halted in 2011 after widespread protests. The outcome will be closely scrutinised by the regional and international communities.
 
 One of the latest hurdles in Thailand is the length of the project’s insurance and interest rates. China is going for a one-year period, but Thailand has insisted on two years, stating that it is standard practice.
 
 Multiple contracts with state and private enterprises in both countries have further complicated deals that need further consultation and consensus. It is no longer a top-down decision as before, especially on the Chinese side. In the case of Thailand, it must be an inclusive process, as civil society and professional groups are important stakeholders.
 
 China understands the significance of the Sino-Thai deal for the rest of the world, especially when the global community is taking a serious look at the BRI schemes. China’s negotiating style and patterns in Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand yield valuable lessons that can improve the BRI’s image and refute the criticism heard worldwide. – Bangkok Post

More than 5800 representatives from 69countries attended the event.
 
 
 
 
 
 “Hong Kong and Myanmar are strategically located along the Belt and Road project. Hong Kong is a major economic entrance to China, a central area for logistics and is also a centre for financial services. On the other hand, Myanmar is a fast-growing country and so will cooperate with Hong Kong and other countries along the Belt and Road project,” U Thaung Tun said.
 
 He said Myanmar’s Sustainable Development Plan will work to include such sectors as investment, finance, logistics, and industry in implementing the Belt and Road Initiative, a global development strategy adopted by the Chinese government involving infrastructure development and investments in 152 countries and international organisations in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas.
 
 “Hong Kong is a strategic location with a lot of potential and will participate in the BRI through cooperation on policies and projects for the BRI by sharing extensive knowledge about the main prospects of Hong Kong, and promotion of Hong Kong’s service industry,” said Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.
 
 Multi-government cooperation, and the creation of economic opportunities between the relevant senior officials of the countries involved in the BRI were discussed by the representatives at the conference.
 
 
 
 
 
 At present, certain restrictions are being removed for both local and global trade, while the policies which protect the interests of their respective countries being practiced. Myanmar is putting its efforts not only into facilitating trade with the ASEAN countries but also with those participating in the conference, said U Thaung Tun.
 
 During the visit, U Thaung Tun met with Lam and Mr. Edward Yau, Secretary of Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong, and discussed the promotion of investment and human resources development between the two countries.
 
 Earlier this month, Yangon Region Chief Minister U Phyo Min Thein presided over the launch of the Myanmar-Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MHKCCI) to promote responsible investment in Myanmar and attract market entrants into the country.

456,The Myanmar Times,https://www.mmtimes.com/news/will-belt-and-road-be-good-myanmar.html,1,,Myanmar,E,2018-08-03 00:00:00,Will Belt and Road be good for Myanmar?,"Some commentators point out the sovereign risk associated with allowing China to build and participate in key infrastructure development in Myanmar. I argue that the BRI should be viewed as a “win-win” rather than as a threat or a form of predatory economics by which the Chinese can export their infrastructure construction model, which heavily relies on state-owned enterprises.
 
 
 
 
 
 The BRI incorporates a few key objectives that ensure that infrastructure projects are sustainable and deliver prosperity across the region through integrated development plans. This was clearly articulated at the 2017 Beijing BRI summit, which gave China a chance to outline its vision of a new global economic order. This was a big step forward for China in demonstrating that it was openly transparent regarding BRI and its intentions.
 
 Xi Jinping’s opening address went to great lengths to extol the Confucian principles of “win-win thinking” that are said to underpin the initiative. “China is willing to share its development experience with the rest of the world, but we will not intervene in other nations’ internal affairs, export our social system and development model, nor force others to accept them,” he said.
 
 Despite these claims, much scepticism has been directed at China’s intentions, driven by the views on what constitutes sustainable development.
 
 Fundamentally the great divide in thinking stems from the West’s approach to development, which measures success in commercial terms and seeks a financial return in three to five years. In contrast, China takes a longer view that incorporates a multi-level return on investment. China has a financial measure, but it also looks at social, environmental and cultural values to measure success over a 10- to 20-year period.
 
 
 
 
 
 These different approaches create different conclusions as to the true motivation behind the BRI.
 
 The Chinese are following a pattern of growth that has been led by investments in building local capability and capacity, which has led to excess capacity being created in their economy, such as in steel production and railway construction. Detractors argue that the BRI is merely a means to redeploy this excess capability by connecting new markets through the construction of key infrastructure.
 
 However, surely the sharing of China’s expertise and knowledge gained from its own experience benefits the recipient country, which no longer needs to invest time and money in a development learning period. Does this not lead to sustainable development, as it lifts communities out of poverty sooner?
 
 Not only is this a “win-win” result, it is compatible with benchmarking techniques used by Western companies to expedite organic growth. Accessibility promotes growth through the BRI economic corridors and routes, and funding allows this to happen.
 
 The current geo-political position suggests that Myanmar has a low sovereign credit rating, which arguably points to capacity to service the debt. This plays to the “win-lose” narrative that claims China is manipulating market and economic conditions to gain control over key assets to create a new world hegemony. This argument has been directed at the Myitsone Dam hydropower project, and as proof points to Pakistan and Sri Lanka having high debt.
 
 The weakness in this argument is the lack of understanding of a long-term investment approach. It also fails to take into account that debt-for-asset swaps are an effective way for a country to lift its citizens out of poverty by creating employment and building the economy. Myanmar needs to expand electricity to 70 percent of the population, which currently relies on substandard and environmentally harmful sources of energy. Electrification is needed to help build a middle class.
 
 Applying western standards to financing would likely mean these projects would not be financed, based on current economic and business models. This is a “win-lose” approach that would condemn Myanmar to prolonged poverty.
 
 The debate about energy and power has distorted the energy market in Myanmar, with funding being limited to “green energy” sources. Myanmar can join the global transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, but could benefit more from China – which has been a leader in green and alternative energy technology – by adopting a wider definition of “green financing.” Recognising the importance of electricity in achieving sustainable development, the BRI makes power generation a central part of its infrastructure plan.
 
 China has been pursuing an energy mix that balances traditional energy sources with renewable energy infrastructure. This is clearly articulated in China’s financial policy, which integrates environmental issues with financial and social decisions and promotes green finance by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, based in Beijing.
 
 Unlike the West, China includes funding for clean coal technology and high-efficiency transport fuel production. This “win-win” approach is critical to ensuring sustainable development in a country like Myanmar, with its large rural population.
 
 Taking a multi-level approach to investment return, I believe that the BRI offers a ‘win-win” and sustainable development opportunity for Myanmar.

 “China wants to join hands with ASEAN for cooperation, construction, mutual benefits, building, trade facilitation and people-to-people understanding. We want to cooperate in infrastructure upgrading too. We are trying to have closer China-ASEAN relationships,” said Chinese Vice Premier and a member of the standing committee of the political Bureau of the Communist of China (CPC) Central Committee Han Zheng in his opening speech at the event.
 
 China will start construction work for Belt and Road Initiative in 2021. The project, a global development strategy adopted by the Chinese government involving infrastructure development and investments in 152 countries and international organisations in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas, was proposed by China’s President Xi Jinping in 2013, and has so far garnered the supports of 152 countries. The main goal for the project is for China to promote trade and economic cooperation between the countries of the world by forming an economic corridor stretching from east to west.
 
 During held Belt One Road Forum in Beijing in April, leaders from more than 30 countries signed BRI cooperation agreements. Representatives from more than 150 countries and 90 international organisations also signed more than 280 agreements valued at more than US$64 billion in connection with the initiative.
 
 “China has signed agreements with all ASEAN countries for the project and has also proposed China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030. The China ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement will come into effect,” said Han.
 
 
 
 
 
 Although ASEAN leaders have agreed to the BRI project, they say they wish for more initiatives that bring prosperity to both sides.
 
 “I have just one suggestion in implementing the BRI, which is to prioritise BRI proposals and the Master Plan for ASEAN Connectivity and 2025 ASEAN Smart City Network. The establishment of economic corridors must be a push for sector-wide development in trading, investment, tourism, benefits for agricultural products and special economic zone. I hope it will be driven by development for all the countries along the project area especially developing countries. I want it to be of benefit to the people of Laos and the countries along the BRI project area,” Laos Deputy Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone.
 
 The investments models under the BRI framework can be used in various ways and for cooperation with the private sector, It can be taken as a suggestion for private-sector development of countries in ASEAN depending on the BRI project, said Siphandone.
 
 On the other hand, regional unity plays an important role in the ASEAN economic community and is the reason for sustainable regional economic development. Establishing roads, ports, railroads, financial and banking systems, and power infrastructures between countries are important for growth in trade, tourism, investment and interaction between people, said Myanmar Vice President U Myint Swe.
 
 “China-Myanmar cooperation brings economic benefits and projects are carried out in accordance with Myanmar’s national plans and priorities with socially responsible and environmentally conservative models. We need to find methods for balanced and compatible cooperation for ASEAN Blueprint 2025 and China’s BRI project. Compatibility between prioritised projects will develop bilateral and regional trade. It will also develop interaction between ASEAN and China. We hope for cooperation with mutual benefits and expect to find opportunities for universal prosperity,” U Myint Swe said.
 
 Myanmar has cooperated with China in implementing of Myanmar-China Economic Corridor, Myanmar-China Border Economic Cooperation Zone, Kyaukphyu Deepsea Port and Special Economic Zone, and Greater Mekong Subregion Cooperation Programme. But detailed information on the implementation of these projects and what benefits Myanmar will see benefits from these projects is still scarce.
 
 “Cambodia supports the BRI project. This proposal offers many benefits for Cambodia’s infrastructure. Construction in Siem Reap has been very helpful for the state’s travel sector. Road infrastructure and businesses have also benefited a lot,” Cambodia’s Deputy Prime Minister Hor Namhong said of BRI projects in his country.
 
 This proposal brings the benfits of integration in the region and opens the economic door wider. For example, it creates better environment for infrastructure construction, trade, investment, finance and monetary sectors. And it means a lot to cooperation between Asia, Europe and Africa, said Hor.
 
 It’s likely that China’s trade volume with ASEAN countries will reach US$1 trillion by 2020, while investment volume is projected to reach US$500 billion, said Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia Hor Namhong.
 
 Myanmar remains the biggest trade partner of China with a trade volume of over US$9.6 billion in fiscal 2018-2019, while China is the second-largest investor volume in Myanmar.
 
 In the BRI project, Myanmar is part of the BCIM Corridor, which includes Bangladesh, China, India, and Myanmar. Another BRI project is the Shwe Gas Pipeline from Kyauk Phyu Port in Rakhine State through Magway, Kyaukpadaung, Chauk, Pyin Oo Lwin, Lashio, and Muse until it reaches Kunming of China.

 China and Myanmar inked dozens of deals on January 18 to speed up infrastructure projects in the Southeast Asian nation, as Beijing seeks to cement its hold over a neighbor increasingly isolated by the West.
 
 But no major new projects were agreed during the two-day visit by President Xi Jinping, the first of any Chinese leader in 19 years. Analysts said Myanmar was generally cautious of investments by Beijing and was also being careful ahead of elections later this year.
 
 Still, Xi and Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi signed 33 agreements shoring up key projects that are part of the flagship Belt and Road Initiative, China’s vision of new trade routes described as a “21st century silk road”.
 
 They agreed to hasten implementation of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, a giant infrastructure scheme worth billions of dollars, with agreements on railways linking southwestern China to the Indian Ocean, a deep sea-port in conflict-riven Rakhine state, a special economic zone on the border, and a new city project in the commercial capital of Yangon.
 
 They did not address a controversial $3.6 billion Beijing-backed mega dam, where work has been stalled since 2011, reflecting the contentiousness of Chinese investment in Myanmar, where many are uncomfortable with the sway Beijing has over its smaller neighbor.
 
 “While a large number of different agreements have been signed, there is no Big Bang here,” said Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based analyst with the International Crisis Group.
 
 “The overall impression is that Myanmar is being cautious about Chinese investment, especially ahead of elections planned later in the year,” he said.
 
 “China will be hoping that this is an incremental step towards realizing its mega-infrastructure goals, and that further progress can be locked in over the coming months,” he said.
 
 ‘Derailed’ by West
 
 At a welcoming ceremony January 17, Xi hailed a “new era” of relations between the countries.
 
 “We are drawing a future roadmap that will bring to life bilateral relations based on brotherly and sisterly closeness in order to overcome hardships together and provide assistance to each other,” Xi said.
 
 Suu Kyi called China “a great country playing an important role in the international affairs and the world economy” but urged for economic projects that avoid environmental degradation and benefit locals.
 
 Xi also met leaders from political parties in ethnic areas riven with civil conflict where Chinese infrastructure projects are underway.
 
 Sai Kyaw Nyunt, joint-secretary of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, one of the ethnic politicians invited to meet Xi, said it was only a handshake.
 
 “Our country is very small and powerless,” he said, “So they treat us that way.”
 
 The two countries have historically had a fraught relationship, but have moved closer since 2017, when Myanmar was internationally condemned for its treatment of a Muslim minority in Rakhine state.
 
 China has defended the country on the global stage and is viewed as the biggest obstacle to a prosecution of its leaders at an international war crimes tribunal.
 
 An article in Chinese state media ahead of the state visit said Myanmar had been “derailed” by its engagement with the West and only China was willing to “pull Myanmar from the sludge”.
 
 “But after some turbulence, Myanmar realized there were double standards in the approach Western countries had taken on human rights issues and began to turn to China for diplomatic and economic help,” the article in the Global Times said.

 Is China's Belt and Road Initiative a bold infrastructure vision, or a slush fund? The question is becoming more pressing.
 
 Chinese officials offered to help bail out state-owned 1Malaysia Development Bhd, kill off investigations into alleged graft at the fund, and spy on journalists looking into it in exchange for stakes in Belt-and-Road railway and pipeline projects in Malaysia, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. If proven, that would offer the clearest link yet between the 1MDB scandal and Belt and Road, still seen by many as a more effective rival to multilateral investors such as the leaderless World Bank and Asian Development Bank. China has denied that money in the programme was used to help bail out 1MDB.
 
 The common perception is that President Xi Jinping's flagship foreign policy initiative is an ambitious programme deploying trillions of dollars on necessary infrastructure in emerging Asian and African countries where Western investors lack the animal spirits to tread.
 
 A variant of this view suggests a greater level of Machiavellian foresight. By getting emerging-economy governments caught in debt traps when unviable projects like Sri Lanka's Hambantota port go belly-up, China is methodically assembling a network of client governments in hock to Beijing and advancing its military ambitions.
 
 Here's a better argument for what Belt and Road is really about. Despite Mr Xi's close association with it, the initiative isn't ultimately a connected master plan for Chinese global ascendancy. Instead, it's better looked at as a chaotic branding and franchising exercise, a way for the country's numerous provincial officials and state-owned companies to slap a presidential seal of approval on whatever project they're seeking to pursue.
 
 ""Far from strictly following Beijing's grand designs, much of the Belt and Road Initiative's activity to date looks more scattered and opportunistic,"" Jonathan Hillman, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic & International Studies, wrote in an analysis last year.
 
 The Journal's reporting suggests a scheme cooked up on the fly, with its key planks initially proposed by Malaysian rather than Chinese officials. By building the railway at a vastly inflated cost, Chinese state companies would be able to get their hands on spare cash and in return assume some of 1MDB's debts.
 
 If Malaysia's Belt and Road projects were all part of a grand strategy hatched by China, the execution was incompetent. According to the Journal, former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak did hold talks with Beijing about granting berthing rights to Chinese naval vessels -- but the discussion never bore fruit. Then Mr Najib was voted out of office last year, with his successor Mahathir Mohamad seeking to cancel or renegotiate projects he's labelled a ""new version of colonialism"".
 
 Other examples abound. Oil and gas pipelines linking a planned US$9.6 billion port in Myanmar to China's Yunnan province are barely being used after five years in operation. A high-speed train to connect Jakarta to Bandung is running at least two years behind schedule and has barely started construction.
 
 Three of the six trans-Asia ""economic corridors"" around which the initiative was designed are devoid of major projects, while countries outside its original scope such as Nigeria and Argentina are being brought under the umbrella. Meanwhile, far from binding governments closer to Beijing, its investments in Malaysia, Sri Lanka and the Maldives have fuelled backlashes bringing China-sceptical governments to power.
 
 Sometimes, as with the projects supported by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Belt and Road brand is going to be stuck on worthwhile but generally small-scale investments. At other times, it will be used to burnish splashy but ill-conceived developments that may never get built.
 
 The prestige of Belt and Road may end up being used to sell projects that are not just illogical but corrupt. If you think the huge web of private contracts, public funds and gatekeeping officials that support infrastructure projects in emerging countries don't offer ample opportunities for graft, I have a bridge to sell you.
 
 All that is reason for foreign observers to be less worried about the geopolitical ambition of Belt and Road, and much more worried about the light it shines on the haphazard and uneconomic nature of Chinese policymaking in the Xi era.
 
 In truth, infrastructure week Beijing-style looks just as disorganised as the Washington version President Donald Trump occasionally floats. The more worrying thought isn't that Belt and Road is a vast conspiracy, but that it's a vast mess. - BLOOMBERG OPINION","['initiative', 'projects', 'vast', 'chinese', 'belt', 'used', 'officials', 'infrastructure', 'governments', 'mess', 'road']","{'Argentina': 1, 'China': 6, 'Sri Lanka': 2, 'Maldives': 1, 'Myanmar': 1, 'Malaysia': 6, 'Niger': 1, 'Nigeria': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 Xi'an International Inland Port Multimodal Transportation Company has unveiled China's plan to launch a freight service from Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi province, to Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, by the end of this year under the much-touted Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
 
 Located in Xi'an International Trade and Logistics Park, the company operates the China Railway Express or Chang'an that runs from Xi'an to Europe and Central Asia. It has had more than 2,788 departures from Xi'an and carried more than 215,382 containers since 2013. The Sino-Europe train is Xi'an's strategy to build a new starting point for the Silk Road Economic Belt.
 
 Zhao Yue, the vice-general manager of the company, said the cargo service for Southeast Asia will differ from Chang'an because it will travel in another direction from North to South.
 
 ""It is based on land and sea transportation. Trains will run from inland cities, like Xi'an, to port cities in Guangxi province and unload cargo to ships that will sail to regional countries, such as Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. We plan to launch operations by the end of this year,"" she told the Bangkok Post at a recent press briefing.
 
 The trip to Xi'an and Weinan was recently organised by the Information Office of Xi'an Municipality and China Radio International (CRI) Online.
 
 Ms Zhao said work on the new freight service, which combines rail and maritime transportation, got underway in August this year.
 
 ""We are beginning the project which covers 12 western cities of China, including Xi'an. Our provincial government is making progress with the plan,"" she added.
 
 The new cargo line will be in addition to the ongoing Sino-Thai high-speed railway project that will be finished by 2023.
 
 Rejuvenating Xi'an
 
 China is now opening up Xi'an to the outside world. Qiang Xiaoan, the deputy mayor of Xi'an Municipal People's Government, stressed the historical significance of the capital city of Shaanxi province for the ongoing BRI.
 
 ""Xi'an was the starting point of the ancient Silk Road. More than 2,000 years ago, Zhang Qian, a Chinese diplomat during the Han dynasty, set off from Xi'an and opened up the avenue of communication between China and the world,"" he said.
 
 Jiang Shaoning, the executive vice-minister of the Propaganda Department of the Xi'an Municipal Committee, said Xi'an has been integrating into the BRI for six years to become a world city and cultural capital.
 
 ""It is seizing the opportunities offered by the Shaanxi Pilot Free Trade Zone and the Belt and Road core area to promote key projects, such as the China-Europe Railway of Chang'an,"" he said.
 
 Zhang Xiaoning, the deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Xi'an Municipal Committee, said Xi'an is upgrading to become the core of the new Silk Road.
 
 ""This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 6th anniversary of the BRI. It is crucial that Xi'an accelerate the construction of the national central city,"" he said.
 
 Boosting the economy
 
 Prinn Panitchpakdi, the deputy leader and head of the economics team of the Democrat Party, said the new freight service will expand Thailand's customer base because China is the world's most populous country.
 
 ""If it comes to fruition, it will improve our under-resourced logistics and boost our trade. However, we must upgrade our products, especially agricultural commodities, to premium quality. It is obvious that China is more assertive in Thailand. Accordingly, we should reposition ourselves and invest [more substantially] in research and development,"" he told the Bangkok Post.
 
 Mr Prinn, who also serves as the country head of CLSA Securities Thailand, warned of the BRI's political repercussions.
 
 ""We must manage our relationships carefully because we are doing business with many countries, such as the United States, Japan, and South Korea.
 
 Therefore, we should not give preferential treatment to any trading partner to avoid offending diplomatic sensitivities,"" he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Pithaya Pookaman, a former Thai ambassador, said the One Belt One Road strategy allows China to flex its muscles.
 
 ""All routes will eventually lead to Beijing. Its growing economy and military force can rival the US. Accordingly, it is natural for China to expand the new commercial route,"" he said.","['rolls', 'heart', 'southeast', 'freight', 'asia', 'belt', 'trade', 'international', 'china', 'xian', 'service', 'road', 'thailand', 'railway']","{'China': 13, 'Indonesia': 1, 'Japan': 1, 'Thailand': 5, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 Pakdee Tanapura, head of the Thai Canal study team at the Thai-Chinese Culture and Economy Association, argued that because of current congestion in the Malacca Strait, the Thai Canal would provide another channel for ships.

 Shipping times between the South China Sea and the Andaman could be reduced by at least two or three days with the distance cut by 1,200km compared with the Strait of Malacca. There are also various benefits for southern Thais.
 
 ""The benefits are obvious in all sectors including industry, agriculture as well as services. But most importantly, the project will help to eliminate poverty from Thai society,"" he told Spectrum.
 
 ""With the injection of massive funds in the first phase of the canal construction which will take five to 10 years to complete, such investments will create demand for highly paid labour forces.
 
 ""This will send a ripple effect into the other sectors of the economy such as transportation, equipments, machine tools and other facilities.""
 
 He expects the Thai Canal project to create more than 3 million jobs within 10 years. On the other hand, southerners will be less dependent on the fluctuating prices of rubber products, palm oil, and other commodities.
 
 ""The latest poll taken among 2,500 villages in 14 provinces conducted by the Songkhla University shows that there is an overwhelming of majority-- 74% -- in favour of the construction of the canal,"" he revealed, while speculating that the canal will help ease the unrest in the South.
 
 ""Putting in more troops does not guarantee security in the region,"" he said.
 
 ""The construction of the Thai Canal will create a more equitable distribution of income, promoting wealth among the population.
 
 ""The project will lay the grounds for solving cultural differences, thus easing existing tensions.
 
 ""A prosperous society is the key to security. In a prosperous society, differences of race and religion will no longer be significant.""
 
 Prof Dr Harald Wagner, a former World Bank consultant who has worked on canals in Europe and now teaches civil engineering at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, told Spectrum that the Thai Canal will be a one-government project, with its 135km length at sea level across Thailand's narrow Isthmus of Kra requiring no elaborate system of locks. Its estimated cost is around US$22-28 billion.
 
 ""A two-government project is much harder to finance in term of geotechnical risk and concession period, while the second biggest advantage of the Thai Canal is that we will not have locks because we do not have to lift the ships up and down three times,"" he said, in reference to the Panama Canal's operations.
 
 ""This is a sea-level connection similar to the Suez Canal in the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea.""
 
 Dr Wagner said the first logical step for the Thai Canal is for the government to finally make a clear decision on its implementation, and then set a timeframe.
 
 ""If the Thai government can make a decision then 2018 and 2019 should be the time for the feasibility study.
 
 ""Two years should be enough because a lot has been done already and all we have to do is to update this information.""
 
 ""After two years we should have contact documents, designs, and we should start a roadshow to sell the project to the contractors,"" he added.
 
 ""We also need to create a Thai Canal society which has the right to give a concession on behalf of the government.""
 
 If the comprehensive feasibility study can be done within two years then the canal could be built within a 10-year timeframe, according to Dr Wagner's estimates.
 
 Ilya Espino de Marotta , executive vice-president of the Panama Canal Expansion Project told Spectrum last year that a sea level canal in Thailand is possible because ""the topography allows it"" and canals are attractive because they are good for both the environment and economy.
 
 ""It is good for the world's environment because you usually provide a shorter route which means there are lower CO2 emissions,"" she said in a capacity as a person who over saw all aspects of the US$5.2-billion Panama Canal expansion from its start in 2007 to its completion in 2016.
 
 ""The [Thai] canal can provide economies of scale because moving goods through water is more advantageous than by land as it should reduce shipping costs.""
 
 The country can also gain from tolls and revenues that come from the users while port and related businesses such as railroad companies can benefit from extra income via transshipment.
 
 ""You can also provide to these ships whatever they need such as food, fuel and repairs,"" she added.
 
 Ms de Marotta's recommendation is to create an in-depth economic and impact research on finance, marketing, environmental concerns, social considerations and engineering before trying to convince people as to how the canal project will benefits the local community and the country as whole.
 
 Panama saw a six-month promotional tour and a national referendum before the expansion project began.
 
 ""At the end of the day, 48% of the population that could vote went to vote, and 75% voted in favour,"" Ms de Marotta said.
 
 ""Once we defined and analysed the project, because we were very concerned with the cost of the project going too high, we decided to stick by it, we did not change anything, we did not modify it, and we still spent $200 million on top of the original estimate, but for a nine-years construction project.""
 
 Meanwhile, Norio Yamamoto, president of the Japanese Global Infrastructure Fund Foundation shared Ms de Morotta's view that the Thai Canal should be funded by multiple parties instead of making a deal with one entity or one government.
 
 This would avoid losing a strategic water way and benefits to a third party, as was the case when the United States and Nicaragua lost out to a Chinese company.
 
 The future of the $50-billion Nicaragua Canal remains unclear after Chinese billionaire Wang Jing promised to bankroll it via his Hong Kong-based HKND (HK Nicaragua Canal Development) Group, But these funds were not forthcoming.
 
 The US was in control of the Panama Canal for 80 years as part of the deal to help Panama gain its independence from Colombia.
 
 It was handed back in 1979, so Panama funded the expansion project, which Ms de Morotta oversaw, itself.
 
 The country put in $2.9 billion of its own money and borrowed a further $2.3 billion from various banks and multilateral lenders such as the World Bank. Panama now earns nearly $2 billion a year in tolls from ships using its waterway.
 
 Dr Yamamoto said the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank are two possibilities for Thailand to borrow from, but the World Bank ""is a typical bureaucratic organisation"" which could pose to be challenging.
 
 The Chinese Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, on the other hand, may play a different role from the ordinary international financing instructions.
 
 ""The Belt and Road initiative is China's national agenda and the Thai Canal could be part of the new maritime Silk Road, so they [the Chinese bank] are very much interested in the project,"" he said.
 
 ""I am not sure whether the Japanese will prioritise the project, because they already have a lot of projects to finance in Asia, but the Thai Canal is closer to Japan and it will create a special route from Japan to the Middle East,"" Dr Yamamoto said.
 
 ""Meanwhile, the Malacca Straits is way too congested to the point that the chokepoint led to the collision between an American ship and an oil tanker,"" he said, referring to the collision between the USS John S McCain with the Liberian merchant vessel Alnic MC in August last year.
 
 The Strait of Malacca is the world's narrowest at 1.5 nautical miles, not to mention one of the world's busiest, with nearly 100,000 vessels passing through it each year, accounting for around a quarter of global traded goods.
 
 ""Within this kind of scope, it is no surprise that Japanese financing groups would want to put a certain portion of their investment into to this area,"" Dr Yamamoto said, while revealing that the project will certainly be under consideration by the Global Infrastructure Fund Foundation if an offer is on the table.","['sea', 'world', 'convenience', 'shortcut', 'bank', 'thai', 'yamamoto', 'society', 'panama', 'create', 'canal', 'cash', 'project']","{'China': 2, 'Colombia': 1, 'Hong Kong': 1, 'Japan': 5, 'Liberia': 1, 'Nicaragua': 3, 'Panama': 8, 'Thailand': 3, 'United States': 5}",,,,,

 The government says the much-touted Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) is ready to be an important part of China's One Belt, One Road initiative, which envisions connectivity between China and Eurasia.
 
 Speaking Monday at a seminar entitled ""Thailand-Hong Kong-Shanghai Strategic Partnership on One Belt, One Road,"" Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak said the EEC will link up with One Belt, One Road via a Thailand-China rail development project. That project will connect Bangkok-Nakhon Ratchasima-Nong Khai with Vientiane, Laos and Kunming, China.
 
 A so-called maritime silk road will link eastern ports to Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean rim.
 
 Thailand is also committed to investing in a submarine cable linking Bangkok with Hong Kong and mainland China in an effort to develop Thailand as the digital hub of Southeast Asia.
 
 The One Belt, One Road refer to China's proposed Silk Road Economic Belt and Maritime Silk Road. Connectivity covers five major areas of interest: Policy coordination, infrastructure construction (including railways and highways), unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people ties. Among these, infrastructure construction is the dominant feature of the New Silk Road.
 
 Mr Somkid said the One Belt, One Road strategy initiated by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 would result in benefits felt far beyond China.
 
 ""The world is now stuck in uncertainty from changes to US international trade policy to the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, along with mounting challenges from global liberalisation policies,"" he said. ""One Belt, One Road is the new hope for the world.""

 Mr Somkid said Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has stressed the significance of Hong Kong as one of Thailand's key strategic partners in helping develop the EEC.
 
 ""The territory has been designated by China to spearhead overseas investment, particularly in Asean, rather than Beijing, thanks to the former's flexible rules and regulations,"" said Mr Somkid. ""Hong Kong is now one of the key pieces of China's One Belt, One Road strategy, designed to promote China's expansion of investment and trade to other regions such as Oceania, North Africa and Thailand, offering a perfect link to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.""
 
 Mr Somkid also called on investors in Hong Kong to invest more in the EEC, while the Thai government is committed to developing infrastructure to facilitate that process, including the Bangkok-Rayong high-speed rail link, expansion of U-tapao airport, the third phase of Laem Chabang, Sattahip port and the double-track rail link connecting Laem Chabang, Map Ta Phut Sattahip port and other residential areas.
 
 He said the government also plans to develop certain areas of the EEC especially for investors from China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan.
 
 The EEC is intended to be a special zone accommodating investment in 10 targeted industries promoted as clusters by the government.
 
 The 10 industries are next-generation cars; smart electronics; affluent, medical and wellness tourism; agriculture and biotechnology; food; robotics for industry; logistics and aviation; biofuels and biochemicals; digital; and medical services.
 
 The corridor spans a combined 30,000 rai in three provinces: Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao. The EEC is an enhancement of the Eastern Seaboard that has been the region's powerhouse for manufacturing and trade.
 
 Industry Minister Uttama Savanayana said after Hong Kong, the government in June plans to hold roadshows in Japan to woo investors to the EEC and help upgrade Thai small and medium-sized enterprises.","['silk', 'belt', 'hong', 'chinas', 'eec', 'tied', 'somkid', 'link', 'kong', 'china', 'road']","{'China': 12, 'United Kingdom': 1, 'Hong Kong': 7, 'India': 1, 'Japan': 2, 'Cambodia': 1, 'Myanmar': 1, 'Thailand': 7, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

But Myanmar’s participation must be based on responsible investments and take into account the risks.
 
 
 
 
 
 This month, U Soe Win, Minister for Planning and Finance, signed an Memorandum of Understanding regarding the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), a key component of the BRI. U Tun Tun Naing, permanent secretary for the Ministry of Planning and Finance, told The Myanmar Times that the government signed an “umbrella agreement”, while agreements on individual projects will have to be negotiated by the ministries from the two sides in the future.
 
 CMEC is a key component in BRI routes, covering a highway project from China’s Yunnan Province to Kyaukphyu via Mandalay, as well as for the Mandalay-Yangon-Mawlamyine route. Beijing is keen to speed up implementation of the proposed highways but Myanmar has difficulties to catch up with such expectations, given the country’s slowing economy and lacklustre investments from Europe and the US.
 
 Political analyst U Ye Htut, a former MP from Thibaw constituency, said that Nay Pyi Taw signed up to the deal quickly so as to secure Chinese investments as well as Beijing’s support for the peace process.
 
 “China’s role in Rakhine affairs, peace matters and investment is important for us. As we take part in the BRI development, we accept that both sides will be fairly benefited. We will share the [fruits of] Chinese development,” U Than Myint, commerce minister, said.
 
 
 
 
 
 As Myanmar risks being isolated by Western countries owing to the humanitarian crisis in northern Rakhine, the country cannot refuse to be part of the BRI framework. Joining the scheme is politically inevitable, analysts said.
 
 The CMEC deal signed covers bilateral collaboration in 15 sectors, including infrastructural development, investment, energy, agriculture, tourism and education. International investors and development agencies across the world will be invited to take part in the implementation process. While loans will be taken from China, call for tenders will invite international firms, according to U Than Myint. Therefore, investments will not only come from mainland China, but also Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and South Korea. It will be a level-playing field and the tender process will be transparent, he said.
 
 “As Myanmar cannot avoid to join the scheme, careful analysis must be done and plans which benefit the country should be implemented. We need to make an effort so our people can secure jobs and expertise and technological know-how could be improved,” U Zaw Win Pe, economic advisor of Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, said.
 
 Sri Lanka and Kyaukphyu
 
 “It is almost certain that it will be advantageous for the Chinese. We should not be paying for those expenditure from our pockets, we must also know how to negotiate with them,” U Ye Tun added.
 
 In June, Sean Turnell, economic adviser to State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, criticised the deep-sea port project. The precedent set by the $1 billion Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, where the government in Colombo borrowed heavily to construct the port, but couldn’t repay the loans and had to give China a 99-year lease for debt relief, is “the example that stands out, that has been really taken notice of in Myanmar,” according to the adviser.
 
 However, U Ye Tun said Kyaukphyu’s case is different and can reap benefits for both countries. The infrastructure, including the port, will make it easier for Myanmar to be a logistics hub as well as to revive its tourism industry.
 
 With more connectivity, it will make Myanmar more competitive in the import and export of good, according to U Zaw Pe Win. Meanwhile, better road conditions will allow more mobility of people.
 
 Domestic analysis said Myanmar should make use of BRI to attract manufacturers to the country, and beware that loans in China carry a higher interest rate than others. Some expressed anxiety over Myanmar losing part of its sovereignty if the country couldn’t repay its Chinese debts.","['commerce', 'tun', 'port', 'minister', 'chinese', 'belt', 'myanmar', 'development', 'bri', 'country', 'investments', 'china', 'tenders', 'nonchinese', 'open', 'signed', 'road', 'project']","{'China': 8, 'Hong Kong': 1, 'Japan': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 2, 'Myanmar': 13, 'Thailand': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

Under this arrangement, both countries agreed to cooperate on many sectors, including infrastructure, construction, manufacturing, agriculture, border economic cooperation zones, “digital Silk Road”, public health, water technology, disaster mitigation, tourism, finance and research and development (R&D), among others.
 
 In particular, the delegation will be pitching five mega projects to investors worldwide: New Yangon City, Yangon-Ayeyarwaddy Development project (Nga Yoke Kaung) and Pathein Industrial City, New Mandalay Resort City, Mandalay’s Myotha Industrial Park and Muse Central Business District (which will be implemented as part of the CMEC). These projects will be showcased in the Myanmar-specific events - Myanmar Investment Roundtable and Myanmar Promotion Seminar - on June 29.
 
 I look forward to talking to international investors and foreign businesses about Myanmar’s economic reforms and investment opportunities.

An academic further lambasted such arrangements as “essentially tools for corporations to restrict access to justice” which will erode community rights, Nay Pyi Taw’s right to regulate as well as Myanmar’s sovereignty.
 
 
 
 
 
 However, other lawyers welcomed the development and were confident that the new courts would be “neutral and fair” and would facilitate BRI expertise, saying that the mechanism is “ultimately a matter of convenience.”
 
 New Belt and Road courts in China
 
 The Chinese embassy in Yangon confirmed to The Myanmar Times on Wednesday that Beijing will set up a new Belt and Road dispute settlement mechanism, but did not comment further on the location or structure of the new courts.
 
 Chinese news media reported that the new BRI dispute settlement mechanism will be comprised of three international commercial courts set up by China’s Supreme People’s Court in Xi’an, Shenzhen and Beijing, with the headquarters in the capital. The court in Xi’an will cover commercial disputes along the Silk Road Economic Belt, a land-based route which runs from western China to Europe and the Middle East through Central Asia, while the Shenzhen court will oversee cases arising along the 21st Maritime Silk Road, a sea route which links the Chinese coast to Europe and Africa via Southeast Asia and other waters. The courts would resemble Singapore’s International Commercial Court and Dubai’s International Finance Centre Courts. It was also reported that Beijing’s top legal body is eager to promote mediation to resolve BRI disputes.
 
 
 
 
 
 BRI projects in Myanmar are ruled, in principle, by existing bilateral or multilateral treaties, according to HRMR lead director Eric Rose. In Myanmar's case, the projects are ruled by the 2012 “Agreement on Dispute Settlement Mechanism of the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Cooperation” between ASEAN and China, and the 2002 Sino-Myanmar bilateral investment treaty. Both treaties provide for similar conflict resolution: consultation, followed by mediation, followed by arbitration by an ad-hoc arbitration tribunal, with no preset venue or choice of law, either procedural or substantive.
 
 In Myanmar, Kyaukphyu is the foremost BRI project but businesses expect more investment projects, especially infrastructure investments, to come in. Hence, this development has huge implications on those businesses who seek to attract Chinese investments.
 
 Existing alternatives
 
 Mr Rose said that there are already existing alternatives than accepting arbitration in China.
 
 In September last year, the Singapore International Mediation Centre and the China Chamber of International Commerce Mediation Centre (CCOIC) entered into an MoU to resolve BRI cross-border disputes. Meanwhile, Dr Shahla Ali, deputy director of Hong Kong University’s arbitration and dispute resolution programme, further confirmed to The Myanmar Times that Hong Kong’s justice department has been developing eBRAM.hk, an online dispute resolution tool for major BRI infrastructure projects.
 
 Given the alternatives, Mr Rose argued, “it really appears that the Chinese government is trying to force the other sides to accept Chinese mediation and arbitration through its proposal to have these three courts rule on all BRI disputes.”
 
 “The BRI recipients, however, always have the option of saying ‘NO!’” he commented.
 
 China’s top legal body has been in the process of “internationalising” its domestic court system and the three new courts are supposed to be modelled after the established ones in Singapore or Dubai. But Mr Rose remained unconvinced.
 
 “Despite these steps, given the ‘novelty’ of these concepts to most Chinese jurists, the imposition of a requirement for BRI projects to be settled in the three Chinese courts smacks of … ‘Chinese Arrogance Concept’. The choice of arbitration venue and law, both procedural and substantive, should be left to the negotiation between the parties,” he said, adding that third party jurisdictions with established rules and an experienced body of jurists are “always preferable to those jurisdictions affiliated with one or the other of the parties to a contract”.
 
 On the contrary, Bob Tseng and Mariano Suarez, partners of Thanlwin Legal, noted that traditional arbitration centres such as Singapore, London and Hong Kong are for highly sophisticated businesses. While these remain worthy options, Belt and Road countries should be “pleased that China is developing these international commercial courts which has expertise in Belt and Road projects and great understanding of Belt and Road participating countries.”
 
 The BRI recipients, however, always have the option of saying ‘NO!’”

 “Bad news for Myanmar”
 
 Not everyone shares that optimism.
 
 For Dr Charlie Thame, lecturer in International Relations at Bangkok’s Thammasat University, having mainland China courts to settle disputes is “bad news for Myanmar” and will undercut sovereignty, community rights, access to justice and, ultimately, democracy.
 
 “This is bad news for Myanmar. It will undermine Myanmar’s sovereignty and empower multinational corporations. Transnational investors have sued states for billions of dollars under similar mechanisms for taking measures to protect public health or the environment, review exploitative contracts acquired through allegations of corruption, promote industrialisation, or even adjust corporate taxes. This has a chilling effect, undermining democratic decision making and restricting states’ right to regulate in the public interest and protect the rights of their people, environment, and resources,” he replied in an email.
 
 Dr Thame argued it is unlikely Myanmar would have been able to review Myitsone Dam or Kyaukphyu SEZ if such provisions were in place.
 
 “These mechanisms are essentially tools for corporations to restrict access to justice. The OECD estimates that expenses for a single Investor-State Dispute Settlement case amounts to $8 million. Even if a state wins, they must pay half of this, so litigation is prohibitively expensive for countries like Myanmar.
 
 “Moreover, it’s unlikely there will be provisions for communities facing negative impacts of these investments: human rights violations, environmental degradation, or loss of livelihoods. Even in internationally reputable permanent arbitration institutions, arbitrators usually interpret investors’ rights broadly, and conflicts of interests are common, since arbitrators sometimes also work as counsels for investors. Many BRI companies are Chinese, and often state-owned enterprises, raising further questions about independence and impartiality of the proposed courts,” he explained.
 
 The academic stressed that governments have a right to regulate and that legal disputes involving transnational investors should be resolved in host states, so governments can protect the interests of their citizens.

 “Reasonable and expected”
 
 But other experts are more positive, seeing that as a natural consequence of China’s rising bargaining power.
 
 Mr Tseng and Mr Suarez defended the new development as “reasonable and expected”, especially when both parties are Chinese corporate entities.
 
 “International dispute resolution is ultimately a matter of convenience.
 
 “China is, in most situations, the ‘investor’ across the many projects within the Belt and Road Initiative. It makes sense that China would enjoy the bargaining power to have any disputes settled within China,” they commented.

 Myanmar courts retain legal authority
 
 William Greenlee from DFDL, who's chair of American Chamber of Commerce Myanmar's legal committee, said that courts in Myanmar will retain the legal authority to review whether an award is in line with the local law even when the arbitration is done outside the country.
 
 “It is true that some local investors and relevant project target governments, in this case Myanmar government, may prefer to have the relevant seat of arbitration in a third country. However, China is experienced in international investing and I assume arbitration in China would be neutral and fair.
 
 “Either way, any resulting arbitration award would have to be enforced by the relevant local government’s courts and such courts generally do have legal authority to review the award and underlying case and determine if fair and/ or complies with local laws,” he said.
 
 He added that it is up to the relevant parties in Myanmar to decide whether to sign up for individual BRI projects and the related arbitration arrangements.
 
 “Some particular [Belt and Road-driven] investments will likely be accepted by the relevant international government and some will not. A condition of any potential arbitration in China is one of many terms that the parties will look at and determine if acceptable or not,” he said.

 The BRI imagines a US$1.3 trillion Chinese-led investment program creating a web of infrastructure, including roads, railways, telecommunications, energy pipelines, and ports. This would serve to enhance economic interconnectivity and facilitate development across Eurasia, East Africa and more than 60 partner countries.
 
 First proposed in September 2013, it is the signature foreign policy initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping. It is a project of unprecedented geographical and financial scope.
 
 BRI has two primary components: the overland Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB), and the sea-based 21st-century Maritime Silk Road (MSR). Together, they form the “belt” and “road”.
 
 
 
 
 
 SREB’s overland infrastructure network encompasses the New Eurasia Land Bridge and five economic corridors: China-Mongolia-Russia; China-Central Asia-West Asia; China-Pakistan; the China-Indochina peninsula; and Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar. The SREB’s connective sinews will be high-speed rail and hydrocarbon pipeline networks.
 
 The MSR is focused on developing key seaports that connect to land-based transportation routes.
 
 China has been at pains to emphasise the co-operative nature of the initiative and its objective of “win-win outcomes”. In his address to the Belt and Road Forum for International Co-operation in Beijing, Xi framed the BRI in terms of “peace and co-operation”, “openness and inclusiveness”, “mutual learning”, and “mutual benefit”.
 
 Yet behind the rhetoric of harmony and mutuality lies a substantive strategy for growing an emerging China-led operating system for the international economy. This could potentially succeed the US-led Washington Consensus and Bretton Woods system.
 
 What China gets from the BRI
 
 BRI projects are likely to increase China’s economic and political leverage as a creditor.
 
 China has established the multilateral Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the $40 billion Silk Road Fund. These are financial vehicles for BRI infrastructure projects, yet the vast bulk of funding to date has come from China’s big state-owned investment banks.
 
 The prospect of access to Chinese financial largesse to fund much-needed infrastructure investments has attracted attention from many prospective partner nations. Many of these appreciate the minimal political conditionalities that come with Chinese finance, in comparison to finance on offer from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.
 
 The BRI has been viewed as a way for China to productively use its enormous, $3 trillion capital reserves, internationalise the renminbi, and deal with structural issues as its economy navigates the so-called “new normal” of lower growth.
 
 Perhaps foremost among these is the issue of industrial over-capacity. Having maxed out investment-driven growth through a frenzy of domestic infrastructure building following the 2008 global financial crisis, the BRI represents an international stimulus package that will utilise China’s idle industrial capacity and safeguard jobs in key industries such as steel and cement.
 
 This is a significant political dividend for the Chinese government. The Chinese Communist Party’s legitimacy rests on maintaining economic growth and improving people’s standard of living.
 
 In relation to energy security, the BRI will assist China in diversifying its energy sources through greater access to Russian and Iranian oil and gas. This will be achieved by linking with pipeline networks from Russia and Central Asia.
 
 By investing in pipelines from Gwadar, on the coast of Pakistan, to Xinjiang, and from coastal Myanmar to Yunnan, China also can diversify its transportation routes for maritime energy supplies. This reduces its vulnerability to energy supply disruption at maritime choke-points in the Strait of Malacca and the South China Sea.
 
 The establishment of port facilities in the Indian Ocean will also be advantageous to the emerging blue-water capability of the People’s Liberation Army Navy. This would assist in keeping vulnerable critical sea lines of communication open for maritime energy supplies from the Middle East.
 
 Collectively, these measures could reduce the ability of the US Navy to blockade China’s energy supply routes in any future conflict scenario.
 
 Geopolitical implications of the BRI
 
 After more than a decade of conjecture about China’s increasing international assertiveness, the Chinese government has now clearly signalled its intention to assume a more prominent global leadership role through the BRI.
 
 China is aiming to spur a new round of economic globalisation, but in a changed international order that it has a pivotal role in shaping.
 
 The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the BRICS New Development Bank, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership are the “software of integration” – the financial pillars of trade and investment in this vision.
 
 The BRI is the development vehicle – the “hardware of trade and investment” and the final pillar on which China’s claim to global leadership rests.
 
 Somewhat paradoxically, given the investment focus on hydrocarbon pipelines, the BRI also represents the vehicle through which China is likely to shape the contours of the emerging international post-carbon economy. The Paris Agreement in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is a keystone document in this respect.
 
 A combination of the climate emergency and market behaviours are making fossil fuel energy production increasingly uneconomic. This has spurred an accelerating transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy generation.
 
 China is a world leader in green and alternative energy technologies. Through the BRI it is well-placed to be the dominant player in facilitating the transition and roll-out of renewable energy infrastructure across Eurasia. This is especially so since the Trump administration has ceded American influence in international climate politics through its repudiation of proactive climate policies.
 
 Leadership on international climate action is one area in which China can develop significant soft power cache, particularly with developing countries of the global south.
 
 China’s BRI announcement is also reflective of the relative decline of the US as the world’s pre-eminent power. A declaration of intent as bold as that made in Beijing over the weekend at the Belt and Road Forum for International Co-operation would have been inconceivable prior to the 2016 US election.
 
 The Trump administration’s clumsy foreign policy manoeuvrings have damaged US prestige, weakened the integrity of a liberal international order already under duress, and opened a window for China to stake its claim.
 
 The BRI also signals a deepening of the Sino-Russian strategic partnership. This is based on a complementary supplier-consumer energy relationship and a mutual antagonism to the US.
 
 However, not all regional countries see the BRI as a boon. The Indian government has expressed reservations over the BRI’s China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and China’s Indian Ocean ambitions.
 
 The BRI now ups the ante for regional middle powers like Australia that have deftly attempted to hedge between the US and China. Australia’s foreign policymakers must weigh up the case for engaging with the BRI and having a seat at the table as China’s vision takes shape.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is expected to provide the impetus to turn Myanmar into a hub, facilitating trade and transport between the three regions, but the lack of infrastructure means that this advantage does not materialise.

 Risks and infrastructures
 
 U Zaw Naing, managing director of Mandalay Technology, urged a change of mindset for Chinese businesses in order to minimise disruption on communities and the environment. Doing so, he said, would help reduce the risk of widespread communal opposition against China-backed projects.
 
 Chinese investors, engineering companies and contractors need to improve the way they look at projects and the way they work and operate - U Zaw Naing, Mandalay Technology
 
 Tomoaki Yabe, managing director of Thilawa-based Daizen Myanmar, said that the BRI provides the impetus to speed up the country’s infrastructure development. This, in turn, raises Myanmar’s competitiveness as a trading and logistics centre in the region.
 
 “Infrastructure improvement on connectivity is vital for the logistics sector. Improvement on roads and railways, ports and power plants, will definitely reduce the time and cost it takes for delivery and transport. This has huge implications for many sectors,” he observed.
 
 U Aung Khin Myint, chair of Myanmar International Freight Forwarders Association (MIFFA), told The Myanmar Times that the Belt and Road Initiative is a boost for transport and trade logistics sectors.
 
 “There are many risks for us when it comes to the BRI, but the risks can be managed. We need to find a solution to balance the benefits and risks,” he said.
 
 The BRI-led momentum in trade projects is timely, given that the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), which Myanmar has ratified, entered into force in February this year.
 
 “The Belt and Road Initiative is timely because the TFA, which Myanmar ratified, has come into force. The Myanmar government is carefully approaching the issue of WTO-TFA guidelines,” he noted.
 
 The Ministry of Transport and Communications is fully aware about the developments of the BRI, according to U Aung Khin Myint. In particular, initiatives for cross-border transport and logistics are gathering steam in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.
 
 “Myanmar and Thailand are going to sign the Memorandum of Understanding [MoU] on bilateral initial implementation of the cross-border transport facilitation agreement [IICBTA] soon. After that, Myanmar and China will sign the same IICBTA MoU. In addition, the highway between Muse and Mandalay will be upgraded from two lanes to four,” he added.
 
 The chair of MIFFA argued in favour of a multi-modal transport for the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) economic corridor. Adopting at least two means of transport connecting Kunming, Mandalay, cities in Bangladesh and Kolkata will be more “effective”.
 
 U Thet Win, MLCA adviser told The Myanmar Times that the organisation signed an MoU with China Real Estate Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong and International Chapter (CRECCHKI) on the same day, hoping to collaborate on developing the real estate sector in Myanmar. myanmar_booth.jpg
 
 Myanmar’s USP
 
 Tomoaki Yabe stressed that Belt and Road’s blueprint for Myanmar revealed the country’s unique selling proposition (USP) but the hardware and software need to complement each other for the USP to work.
 
 “Myanmar’s role in the BRI’s two economic corridors demonstrates its geopolitical importance in bridging China and South Asia, China and ASEAN as well as ASEAN and South Asia. But this geopolitical USP - i.e. bridging ASEAN, China and South Asia - cannot be realised unless its regional infrastructure is in place.
 
 Being strategically located, Myanmar is where the Belt and Road ambition meets the ASEAN vision. - Tomoaki Yabe, Daizen Myanmar
 
 “Apart from the hardware, i.e. good roads and railways, the country needs to upgrade its software, such as customs operations, cross-border arrangements, insurance sector, regulations and many more.
 
 “The introduction of bonded warehouse, cross-border logistics pilot scheme, new Investment Law and the pending Companies Act are evidence that Myanmar is taking the rights steps to upgrade its software to position itself as the ASEAN-China-South Asia logistics and trading centre. But the hardware needs a lot of money to be built and there’s a lot to be done. BRI investments will be crucial.
 
 U Zaw Naing agreed with Mr Yabe’s view: the country is where ASEAN and Belt and Road converge. This line has time and again been echoed by politicians and pundits in the country. However, he added that Myanmar cannot afford to rest on its laurels because other countries, such as Vietnam, are well ahead in bridging the regions.
 
 “It is quite a challenge to see how long the window of opportunities currently open for Myanmar will remain open,” he remarked.
 
 The BRI will shape Myanmar’s infrastructure to become a hub between China and South Asia because that is of China’s national interest, according to U Zaw Naing.
 
 “Again, it is China’s utmost interest to develop the Kunming-Kyaukphyu railway, and possibly an elevated highway as well, as the trading and logistics route for western China. This will make up an important component of the BRI and the BCIM corridor. It links China up with the western part of the world without going through the Malacca Straits,” he said, adding that Myanmar may benefit from a significant increase in inflow of FDI and in terms of job creation. But there are concerns regarding land confiscations, environment degradation and impacts on communities.
 
 “In addition, Myanmar is involved in the China-Indochina Peninsula economic corridor, which encompasses many ASEAN countries. This corridor has seen a significant level of infrastructure already established,” he told The Myanmar Times.
 
 Chinese firms displacing others
 
 U Zaw Naing was concerned that Belt and Road is going to help Chinese companies displace Myanmar and international companies in Myanmar.
 
 “We do see such trends. We have concerns that Chinese firms are moving beyond contractor work to become project owners and investors. The general public is worried that Chinese companies will control the ownership of the projects, facilities, real estate, roads, railways and the land of Myanmar.
 
 “There have been complaints that Chinese contractors are bringing in Chinese workers to Myanmar for many projects. We are not talking about only the high-level experts such as engineers or technicians, but also the labour workers. This means that people in the host country, i.e. Myanmar in our case, cannot benefit from the jobs created,” he said.
 
 In contrast, Mr Yabe brushed off concerns that Chinese companies will displace domestic and international firms, as long as Myanmar provides a level-playing field for businesses.

 Before the official start of the forum, she paid a call on the Chinese president to express her appreciation for the strengthening of bilateral relations between China and Myanmar as well as future cooperation under the BRI.
 
 President Xi said he desired the strengthening of mutually beneficial cooperation with Myanmar within the BRI framework.
 
 According to a statement from the Office of the State Counsellor, the heads of state also discussed the acceleration of cooperation between the two countries to improve the lives of their citizens.

 Launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 as “One Belt, One Road”, the initiative involves China underwriting billion-dollar investments, mainly in physical infrastructure, in countries along the land-based Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road, creating an extensive trade network by linking the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa. The financial commitment illustrates the ambition: China is spending roughly US$150 billion a year in the 68 countries which have signed on to the project.
 
 While President Xi announced his grand plan when he visited Kazakhstan and Indonesia in 2013, the BRI did not attract the attention of the government, private sector and media in Myanmar until State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi paid a visit to the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in the Chinese capital in May.
 
 During a roundtable session of the forum on May 15, the State Counsellor said that connectivity covers not only physical or infrastructure connectivity, but also institutional connectivity and people-to-people connectivity. Because of its multi-facetted nature, connectivity cooperation would need to complement existing national and regional platforms.
 
 Daw Suu also stressed that BRI-led projects would be the most effective if they are designed to re-enforce or complement existing or planned projects of participating countries and regional organisations. This is because the priority must be to take into account the expectations and concerns of individual governments and the peoples.
 
 
 
 
 
 She added that each partner country has its own considerations and the best multi-national initiatives are those which align well with national plans. Myanmar has laid out its own Road Network Master Plan and it is also taking part in a number of ongoing regional projects.
 
 The State Counsellor emphasised the need to ensure that business activities are carried out in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. Conservation of the natural environment and welfare of local communities are essential for the success of development projects. The creation of employment opportunities for the local people is also an important factor.
 
 The State Counsellor’s concerns echo those of the business community.
 
 The McKinsey senior partner told The Myanmar Times in June that success of the BRI in Myanmar would depend on the country creating an investor-friendly environment and developing sufficient human capital. Additionally, human capital poses a bigger challenge than the financial issue and would determine how the country fares compared to the rest of ASEAN.
 
 “Myanmar, given its size, population and proximity, would be very well-positioned to benefit from those investment flows. Whether in fact it does, depends on the investor-friendly environment and the availability of human capital for support.
 
 “I don’t think financial capital is the big issue here – there’s more than enough money around – but how to put to good use in getting good projects, earn a return, and can be sustainably managed by a local workforce determines how much of that capital actually comes to Myanmar,” he said.
 
 Benefits and risks
 
 Myanmar’s role in the BRI is very clear and obvious. Local economists are estimating the benefits and risks associated with the country hopping on the BRI train.
 
 Opportunities are policy coordination, which contributes to a better Sino-Myanmar strategic cooperation and which offers bilateral policy coordination in multilateral frameworks.
 
 The benefits also include a boost for infrastructure and connectivity, fewer barriers for trade via bilateral economic and trade cooperation and financial integration, resulting in more foreign direct investment (FDI), and a better standard of living.
 
 At the same time, BRI presents many challenges. It is essentially a great-power game at a multilateral level, according to numerous analysts The Myanmar Times interviewed. Additionally, there are cognitive differences between China and Myanmar on the definition of a win-win cooperation. Myanmar’s internal dilemmas and issues regarding religion, ethnic minorities, devolution and the peace process are all uncertainties which might negatively affect Sino-Myanmar relations.
 
 U Aye Lwin, member of NLD Central Executive Economic Committee, said that high-level cooperation such as G-to-G coordination is required but it is imperative to strengthen civil and non-governmental interactions between the two countries.
 
 He suggested that it is necessary to leverage traditional media as well as other new channels to promote Myanmar and facilitate bilateral relations with short-term and long-term considerations taken into account.
 
 
 
 
 
 FDI and foreign loan
 
 China is the top investor in the country, accounting for more than a quarter (26 percent) of the total foreign investment as of July 31, according to the data released from Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA).
 
 The picture is similar in terms of foreign debt: Myanmar has accumulated foreign loan totalling US$9.16 billion and 44pc of that sum was borrowed from China.
 
 Economist U Khin Maung Nyo, vice president of Myanmar Economics Association noted that China has been offering loans to some of the countries in Asia. But countries such as Myanmar should be concerned with the debt trap.
 
 U Aye Lwin added that the country is situated between two giant markets but it has so far failed to translate that geographical advantage into economic strength in the past years.
 
 “It is not possible to deviate from the direction set by your neighbouring countries.
 
 “This time, I think it is a good opportunity to get ahead with the economic development scheme of the region.
 
 “The important priority is to improve infrastructure to the areas covered by the BRI.
 
 Enhance the infrastructure in BRI-related regions and develop the transport, tourism and businesses there. The government needs to liberalise rules and regulations to improve the ease of doing business,” he said.
 
 Earlier, The Myanmar Times interviewed Jonathan Woetzel, McKinsey senior partner, Bernard Chan, president of Asia Financial Holdings and grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, as well as domestic and international businesses from various countries and industries on the scheme’s implications, opportunities and challenges for Myanmar.
 
 Mr Chan noted that physical infrastructure is the first phase of the BRI.
 
 “The first wave of these so-called initiatives will be about infrastructure, followed by trade and then other development such as tourism. Infrastructure is the most imminent,” he said.

 “There is a risk that benefits of BRI road projects could be replaced by substantial social, environmental and economic costs, if roads are constructed in ways that fragments the ecosystems, endangers wildlife, or contributes to deforestation, landslides, and pollution. Through better planning and design, these risks can be avoided and mitigated,” Hanna Helsingen, green economy programme and policy manager at WWF-Myanmar commented. The report, released last month, seeks to provide a rapid assessment of Belt and Road-related opportunities and risks for Myanmar in terms of natural capital impacts and dependencies.
 
 Vicky Bowman, director of Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business, said that issues could be avoided if infrastructure projects are planned and designed in line with Myanmar’s EIA framework, with assessments carried out in a manner which meets the standards of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and World Bank, including undertaking meaningful consultation and revisions to prevent, reduce and mitigate impacts.
 
 “There are certainly gaps in laws. For example, Myanmar does not have a full set of environmental and construction standards yet, and there are no rules on biodiversity offsets.
 
 
 
 
 
 “But the challenge is predominantly one of government enforcement, and by extension, developer attitude. Some developers seek to apply the law by doing projects to international standards. Others cut corners and try to do as little as possible, unless they are called to account by governments or others,” the expert explained.
 
 BRI corridors in Myanmar
 
 “The report focuses on how construction of infrastructure in two proposed East-West and North-South road corridors depend and could affect on the country’s natural capital assets, the very foundation of Myanmar’s sustainable development,” Sai Nay Won Myint, WWF’s green economy officer further added.
 
 Myanmar's natural capital is vital for mitigating the severe impacts of natural disasters on the country's built infrastructure, including roads.
 
 
 
 - Report, WWF
 
 A core part of the Beijing-led Belt and Road Initiative is the creation of economic corridors to boost connectivity, improve trade of goods and facilitate investments. This will in turn catalyse the trade in services and tourism.
 
 The report Repaving the ancient Silk Routes, published by PwC Growth Markets Centre last year, illustrated how Myanmar is involved in two out of six economic corridors in Beijing’s grand scheme: the “amphibious” Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar (BCIM) corridor, and maritime China-IndoChina Peninsula corridor.
 
 The BCIM corridor is designed to strengthen connections between China’s Yunnan Province and the neighbours, as well as integrating the regional economy in the Bay of Bengal while the latter captures many of China’s connectivity projects within ASEAN.
 
 The two corridors which the report investigated are the East-West corridor connecting China through Mandalay and Myanmar’s heartland with South Asia, as well as the North-South corridor linking the East-West corridor with the Indian Ocean via Yangon.
 
 Development opportunities for Myanmar
 
 Roads and road construction in the BRI’s East-West and North-South corridors could make significant contributions to Myanmar’s socio-economic and infrastructure development. Roads in these corridors would connect major urban centres and communities across the country with major cities and markets in neighbouring countries, notably Bangladesh, China and India.
 
 Experience in other developing economies reveals that BRI road proposals in Myanmar could potentially enhance access to jobs, education and healthcare, improve economic productivity, raise incomes, reduce trade costs and barriers and accelerate growth of both agriculture and industrial clusters.
 
 Substantial risks to natural capital
 
 However, the report went on to argue that BRI road infrastructure could affect natural capital assets and associated benefits which people enjoy from natural capital. This includes lower risk of landslides, flooding and water pollution. The publication also noted how the resilience and durability of the BRI road corridors would potentially depend upon “ecosystem services” – flood and erosion risk reduction offered by natural ecosystems.
 
 The BRI corridors cut through the areas of the Ayeyarwady River Basin and surrounding areas which accommodate around 24 million people. These people rely on the natural capital to access potable water, main dry-season water supply, reduce risks from natural disasters, among other critical reliance.
 
 There is a risk that benefits of the BRI projects could be undermined by considerable socio-economic and environment costs which would happen if roads are built without taking into account the environment, wildlife and its implications on communities.
 
 Recommendations
 
 Sai Nay Won Myint explained that good planning and design is crucial.
 
 “We must better take into account information about the environment, when roads and other projects are planned and designed. This is the only way we can actually avoid negative environmental and social impacts, which is much economically cheaper than mitigating impacts at a later stage of the project,” Sai Nay Won Myint added.
 
 The report recommends:
 
 1. The need to ensure that the BRI follows a sustainability criteria or standard based on ‘Guidance on the Building of the Green Belt and Road’ released from the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, global sustainability standards or nationally developed standards for sustainable infrastructure development.
 
 2. More assessments to better understand risks related to for example floods, erosion and biodiversity, and for this information to be incorporated into road plans and designs as well as high quality Environmental Impact Assessments and Environmental Management Plans (EIAs).
 
 3. Avoid negative environmental and social impacts through assessing multiple costs of road location and planning.
 
 4. The BRI design should enhance environmental, social and economic benefits, including buffer zones, re-vegetation of slopes and wildlife corridors.
 
 5. Myanmar civil society should be included at all levels and stages of project planning to avoid negative social and environmental impacts and optimise benefit sharing of the BRI in Myanmar.
 
 What is natural capital?
 
 Natural capital is a term for the stock of renewable and non-renewable resources – e.g. plants, animals, air, water, soils and minerals – which combine to yield a flow of benefits to people.
 
 The benefits provided by natural capital are collectively called ecosystem services, including clean air, safe food, water, energy, shelter, medicine and raw materials we use to make products. Natural capital also offers less discernible benefits such as flood defence, climate regulation, pollination and recreation.","['environmental', 'projects', 'benefits', 'corridors', 'population', 'belt', 'natural', 'capital', 'report', 'infrastructure', 'myanmars', 'bri', 'risk', 'road', 'half']","{'Bangladesh': 2, 'China': 9, 'India': 3, 'Myanmar': 17}",,,,,

 Much of the focus on China’s grand scheme in Myanmar has surrounded the development of the proposed Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and deep-sea port in Rakhine State. However, the BRI has a much broader implication on Myanmar both economically and politically.
 
 Back in 2014, Professor Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese Studies and director of the Lau China Institute at King's College, London, wrote that China can no longer reign supreme in many ASEAN member states, despite its economic muscle.
 
 “Chinese investment and trade are all welcome [in Cambodia], but the days of Beijing supremacy are long over,"" he wrote in an article.
 
 “A similar pattern can be seen in Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines and Laos. The era of stark choices between friends and enemies fostered by the Cold War has left a region with blurred allegiances and almost constantly changing loyalties,” he argued, adding that “China can search for leverage in vain in this new context, but it knows than even endless amounts of trade, aid, and financial largesse don’t buy much any longer.”
 
 
 
 
 
 Myanmar's trump card
 
 These days, Nay Pyi Taw has more options beyond Beijing.
 
 “Myanmar occupies a unique position. It has travelled in the last few years from being a relatively dependent partner of China because of its diplomatic and economic isolation to one which, because of reforms and changes in the country, now has a much more diverse group of relations.
 
 “This has allowed it more autonomy and a less severe form of China-centric links. It's newly evolving relations with the US and the EU mean it simply has, very suddenly, more options,” he said.
 
 Still, China’s leverage over some ethnic armed groups in Myanmar can be seen as a political “trump card” over Nay Pyi Taw. The ethnic peace process is a top priority for State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the participation of those ethnic armed groups is essential for the peace process.
 
 Dan Wang, an analyst in The Economist Intelligence Unit‘s Access China service, told The Myanmar Times that Beijing’s sway over some ethnic armed groups has given China significantly more leverage over Myanmar than many ASEAN countries.
 
 “China has a bigger influence over Myanmar than other ASEAN members, because Myanmar relies on China to be a mediator in its ethnic civil wars. Other ASEAN countries do not face similar challenge in domestic stability.
 
 “Many of the ethnic armed groups have strong ethnic and cultural ties with China. For Aung San Suu Kyi, the top priority is to achieve peace and unity within the country. The National League for Democracy is unlikely to power through the democratic reform in the next two years, the military threat to take over power remains a real threat,” the Beijing-based analyst said.
 
 According to Ms Wang, China has several additional advantages over the US in terms of influence over Myanmar: China’s geographical proximity, Beijing’s willingness to extensively offer loans, technology and investment in the country's infrastructure through BRI framework, and the Chinese government has a relatively generous policy in taking in Myanmar refugees. The combination of these factors means China has a larger say in Myanmar’s internal affairs, compared to the US.
 
 However, Professor Brown argued that China would be hesitant to use this “trump card” in order to gain Nay Pyi Taw’s backing for its Belt and Road Initiative.
 
 “It [pushing those ethnic armed groups loyal to Beijing towards Nay Pyi Taw in exchange for Myanmar's support of BRI] would be a very extreme form of China trying to gain influence, particularly in view of its own vulnerability with regard to the management of ethnic minority issues.
 
 “It would also lay it exposed to the accusation that it was violating one of the most important parts of its rhetoric of diplomacy - non-interference in the affairs of others. This does not preclude informal and under-hand contact and support from Beijing - but the risks of being found out would be high, as would reputational loss.
 
 “China can use overt means to influence other countries now. Its covert era of activity belongs more to the past, particularly the Maoist past,” he said.
 
 Benefiting from China
 
 Ms Wang said that Myanmar should leverage not only China’s investments, but also the Chinese market.
 
 “The best strategy for Myanmar would be to leverage on China's willingness to invest and expand its influence in Asia. China could be intimidating with its economic size and aggressive investment plans, but it is also the largest market.
 
 “As Myanmar becomes more open, tourist arrivals from China have surged; foreign trade also rose rapidly with improved infrastructure,” she said.
 
 The analyst added that Yunnan will play a pivotal role as a transport hub with South Asia and ASEAN, under the BRI, pointing to examples such as the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor (BCIM) and high-speed railway links with Southeast Asia.
 
 “The province shares a border with Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, which gives it a natural strategic importance.
 
 “Commercial ties between Yunnan and ASEAN countries, especially with Myanmar, have expanded since the signing of a free-trade agreement between China and ASEAN in 2010.
 
 “Electricity exports to Vietnam and Laos by Yunnan Power Grid, a subsidiary of the state-owned China Southern Power Grid, are growing quickly, highlighting the province's expanding role as a power supplier to neighbouring countries. Yunnan Power Grid sources some of its energy supply from Myanmar, where the company is involved in a controversial hydropower dam project,” she said.
 
 Bargaining power
 
 Myanmar and other ASEAN countries should strategically work out what things they actually want from China in terms of investment, economic and political links, according to the professor at King’s College. They should also work out the benefits and risks of having deeper links with China, and more solid partnerships and trying to set out ways in which these can be mitigated and work out their own strengths and weaknesses regarding how to deal with China and what China wants from them.
 
 “The Belt and Road Initiative is an invitation by China to deal more with its growth, development and opportunities that flow from this. But every country in the region will have different perspectives on how best to deal with this opportunity,” Professor Brown said.
 
 Ms Wang argued that the BRI focuses on bilateral frameworks than ASEAN as a bloc.
 
 “The BRI has a strong influence to ASEAN development, but more on the bilateral terms, rather than with ASEAN as a whole. In recent years especially, as China has advanced aggressive territorial claims in the South China Sea, ASEAN has struggled to establish a common position on the disputes. In fact, aside from rough geography, there is no obvious trait that binds the ten nations together.
 
 “China has less trouble in its investment plans in small countries like Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, but more in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia over issues like environment, labour dispute and crowding out local businesses,” she explained.
 
 More significantly, the EIU analyst pointed out that Myanmar does not have much bargaining power over China’s scheme, contrary to what many domestic politicians and pundits said.

 “Myanmar’s bargaining power over China’s investment plan is relatively weak, for its lack of infrastructure and funding.
 
 ""From experiences of African countries, the locals benefit from improved roads and rails, although environmental issues become acute in certain areas,” she said.
 
 Dan Wang stressed that Myanmar should take advantage of this scheme when Chinese President Xi Jinping is still in office.
 
 “Given that Xi Jinping is the major force behind BRI, Myanmar is best to take advantage of the policy when he is still in power [possibly till 2022 or even five more years after that],” she said.","['bargaining', 'countries', 'asean', 'wang', 'rises', 'belt', 'investment', 'chinas', 'china', 'myanmars', 'bri', 'myanmar', 'power', 'road', 'ethnic']","{'Bangladesh': 1, 'China': 39, 'Hong Kong': 1, 'Indonesia': 1, 'India': 1, 'Cambodia': 2, 'Myanmar': 30, 'Philippines': 1, 'Thailand': 1, 'United States': 3}",,,,,

 For infrastructure development, local projects with long term benefits such as better international connectivity should be prioritised, while the terms and conditions of use should be well-negotiated, said Dr Zaw Oo, economic adviser to the former president of Myanmar.
 
 Analysts agreed that the government should push for more build, operate and transfer (BOT) arrangements when implementing infrastructure projects.
 
 “The government should not agree to implement projects by taking loans as it may not be able to recover its investment on the infrastructure project. Such developments involve heavy capital expenditure and cost a lot to upkeep. As such, raising funds through debt may not be in the country’s best interests. It would be better to go for BOT arrangements,” said U Zaw Pe Win, a local analyst.
 
 For development that is sustainable and beneficial for both countries under the BRI project, long-term financial plans and a good system to ward of regional financial dangers are important, the State Counsellor said.
 
 
 
 
 
 “BRI projects need to be in accordance with the priorities and development projects of the participating countries. The project feasibility should consider not only economical but also social and environmental responsibility. The most important thing is to get local support. If the people of the participating countries are convinced that BRI would have positive effect on them, the project’s goals can be accomplished,” Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said.
 
 Myanmar will prioritise nine infrastructure projects under the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, which is part of the BRI. These include basic infrastructure such as power grids, roads and bridges.

 “Myanmar has always attached and continues to attach great importance to Hong Kong. We are aware that Hong Kong is one of the best places in the world to do business.
 
 “Myanmar recognises Hong Kong’s distinctive role as the superconnector in the BRI,” he remarked at the welcoming reception. Trade between the two regions reached US$386 million last year, while the city accounted for more than 10pc of the total approved FDI flow in the country. Numerous multinationals associated with Hong Kong, including Hutchison Ports, Jardine Matheson, Kerry Logistics, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts and Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, are active in Myanmar.
 
 “Our relations go way back to the colonial times. We want to provide a mutually beneficial relationship.
 
 
 
 
 
 “With Myanmar opening up, there is an opportunity for Hong Kong investors to jump on the bandwagon and join the great numbers of investments coming to Myanmar. Hong Kong is an extremely well-connected city, and Myanmar is only three hours away by flight,” the MIC chair continued. Citing the new Investment Law and Companies Law, he stressed that “the time is ripe to invest in Myanmar” and pledged that the country “will be transparent, efficient, and friendly to our investors” to “seek to promote responsible investment.”
 
 U Thaung Tun, along with the UK’s trade minister Baroness Fairhead and other officials, spoke at the Summit’s luncheon plenary. He said that closing Myanmar’s infrastructure gap can “contribute to the ongoing peace process” and wooed the audience to invest in transport and energy infrastructure, vowing to provide “a level-playing field” for foreign investors.
 
 At a sideline interview, Melvyn Pun from Yoma Strategic Holdings urged the Myanmar government to step up efforts in the BRI.
 
 “I believe the government needs to take a much more proactive role in identifying the key opportunities for Myanmar.” The BRI is about investments and connectivity in Asia, particularly China, and hence Myanmar can take advantage of that by “plugging some of the infrastructure gaps that we have”.
 
 Instead of waiting for road or railway proposals, Myanmar should identify her own priorities and key areas which the country wants to attract capital. Regarding the country being too passive, “I think this is a point about the BRI but also a point, more broadly, that Myanmar is sometimes too reactive in waiting for investors to come.”
 
 “If you look at the Hong Kong’s approach, such as the HKTDC who arranged the Summit and also, for example, Singapore and even Chinese regional governments, they are very proactive in reaching out and looking for those investors and partners who they want to bring into the country. I think Nay Pyi Taw can take that approach,” Mr Pun commented. Beyond infrastructure, Myanmar can collaborate with Hong Kong and China in IT-related investments such as e-commerce and mobile money.
 
 I believe the government needs to take a much more proactive role in identifying the key opportunities for Myanmar. - Melvyn Pun, Yoma Strategic
 
 John Barnes, director of Marga Group, said there are a few criteria which Myanmar should focus on in order to attract BRI investments.
 
 Firstly, commercial terms and contract arrangements must be matching with other international investment destinations, he pointed out. “The world has seen multiple economies open and globalise. While each market has its own pace of development and unique traits, business models largely follow the same trajectory. Investors will balance the risks and rewards across markets, hence both investment risks and incentives should be clear and competitive from the get-go.”
 
 Secondly, access to financing for Myanmar, which is limited compared with the rest of ASEAN, needs to be addressed. For the private side, local consumers need to access credit at more reasonable rates for purchases of homes and other investments. “We constantly see emerging market taking off with the introduction of comprehensive mortgage laws and other credit tools. Foreign currency loans such as US dollar-denominated loans can be introduced too.”
 
 Mr Barnes said that direct active engagement with investors is always the first step in promoting inward investments, using the example of U Thaung Tun’s visit to the city. Another step is to organise tours and bring potential government partners and investors to Myanmar, as well as community engagement early on. “The local community should be briefed about the advantages of having foreign direct investment, including the economic and social benefits. History has taught us that foreign capital will always enlarge the pie and create more wealth for everyone, but some people feel that FDI create unnecessary competition and social problems. These negative feelings can be eliminated with proper planning,” the director explained.

 Meanwhile, Vincent Lo, chair of the HKTDC, warned that the looming trade war between America and China means the BRI is more important than ever, as countries can avoid trade frictions by producing and selling locally.
 
 Peter Beynon, chair of British Chamber of Commerce Myanmar, who was also present for the Summit, observed that the specific published projects of the BRI in Myanmar will link Yunnan Province - and the whole of western China - to the Indian Ocean both logistically and as a trade route. “The infrastructure that will be required to achieve this objective will surely bring employment and prosperity to Myanmar. I am optimistic that properly embraced, the BRI will be positive for the country and the people of Myanmar,” Mr Beynon commented. However, this does not mean that Myanmar merely “opens its doors and welcomes everything”.
 
 “Myanmar must scrutinise each project on its merits and ensure that there is true value and real benefits to the people of the country and the economy,” the business leader went on.
 
 Similarly, a Japanese logistics pioneer headquartered in Thilawa Special Economic Zone who joined the delegation is keen to capitalise on the cross-border trade between China and Myanmar: Tomoaki Yabe, managing director of Daizen, said that private businesses are supportive of efforts to improve the infrastructure and boost trade, given that projects adhere to international standards and are fair and transparent for all players.
 
 His logistics firm, which is Myanmar’s first bonded warehouse and freezone warehouse operator, is set to open an office in Myawaddy within the next few months. The Yunnan-Shan cross-border logistics will be the next move.
 
 “Our next target is possibly branching out to Muse, where Yunnan-Shan border trade is expected to be a major area of growth,” Mr Yabe noted.","['throws', 'superconnector', 'belt', 'trade', 'hong', 'investors', 'country', 'infrastructure', 'investments', 'kong', 'bri', 'myanmar', 'road', 'weight', 'investment']","{'China': 5, 'Hong Kong': 10, 'India': 1, 'Japan': 1, 'Myanmar': 29, 'Singapore': 1, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 In July 2016, McKinsey predicted that the future of trade in Asia could depend heavily on China’s expansive Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which called for massive investment in and development of trade routes in the region.
 
 According to Kevin Sneader, McKinsey’s chair in Asia, the BRI has the potential to be the world’s largest platform for regional collaboration. There are two parts to the scheme: the belt and the road. The belt is the physical road, which takes one from China all the way through Europe to somewhere up north in Scandinavia. That is the physical road. What the Chinese government calls the road is in fact the maritime Silk Road, in other words, shipping lanes, essentially from China to Venice. The ambitious scheme covers about 65 percent of the world’s population, about one-third of the world’s GDP, and about a quarter of all the goods and services the world moves. The core of all these is an extensive trading network.
 
 Given its geographical proximity, ASEAN is an important player in this scheme. According to Mr Sneader, for example, the Indonesians are clearly excited about how is this going to play out. Jakarta Globe reported that Indonesia sought to draw up to US$28 billion worth of investment from Chinese investors from hundreds of projects put on the table during the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing last month.
 
 Despite all the discussions and hype surrounding the scheme, in Myanmar there has not been much information or clarity about how the BRI is going to make a difference, apart from some developments in Kyaukphyu.
 
 
 
 
 
 On June 1, The Myanmar Times interviewed Jonathan Woetzel, senior partner of McKinsey & Company and Asia-based director of the McKinsey Global Institute about the BRI, its implementation obstacles, its finances and its priorities in Myanmar. He is an expert on many China-related issues, including the BRI and the country’s urbanisation development.
 
 First of all, it is unclear who is running the initiative. Every province has its own BRI investment plan, as do hundreds of SOEs. Mr Woetzel said there wasn’t one single person in charge of the scheme. The leadership in Beijing has set out the vision but most of the actual project is implemented by individual provinces, regions and companies.
 
 “There is a One Belt One Road office associated with National Development Reform Commission. But it’s much more of a coordinator and a facilitator than a decision-maker. That is very typical of China’s central government management: They set the idea out, they try to set up institutions to support the idea, but then they allow most of the project development and initiative to become bottom-up,” he said.
 
 The MGI’s report China’s role in the next phase of globalisation published in April 2017, of which Mr Woetzel is a joint-author, suggests that the country has opportunities to build on the momentum of the BRI by placing its capital and expertise into international infrastructure projects.
 
 Bernard Chan, grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, late founder of Bangkok Bank, also told The Myanmar Times that infrastructure, and specifically Chinese state-owned enterprises-led infrastructure development, would be the scheme’s priority at this stage.
 
 But the McKinsey expert pointed out that most of the investments made across the economy would be made through industry and manufacturing because there was more activity. Infrastructure has bigger numbers in terms of investments for large-scale projects. However, the big picture would not be dominated by infrastructure.
 
 “Even China understands that investing in infrastructure, by itself, doesn’t get you anything – it doesn’t do anything for an economy, only economic activity does that.
 
 “There’s going to be at least as much investment in developing economic activity as there will be in infrastructure, largely made by large companies and not by state-owned enterprises,” he explained.
 
 The lion’s share of funding from the private sector
 
 The BRI region, including Myanmar, has been promised a significant boost in the financing available for infrastructure development. But the plethora of institutions is confusing: the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Silk Road Fund, the China Development Bank, the Export and Import Bank of China and many organisations. In terms of outstanding loans or equity investment by the end of 2016, the big four state-owned commercial banks had provided $150 billion, China Development Bank $110 billion, the Silk Road Fund $4 billion, Export-Import Bank of China $24 billion and the AIIB and New Development Bank (aka BRICS bank) $2 billion each, according to the Financial Times.
 
 The Myanmar Times asked Mr Woetzel whether the major funding source will be multilateral institutions, bilateral ones or the private sector. He said all of the organisations would be a part of it but the private sector will take the lion’s share.
 
 “I don’t think there will be one source of funding available that will cover all the infrastructure or economic development needs of the country. Historically, financing has come from the government’s own revenues – the borrowing capacity. Additionally, multilateral funding, whether it’s from the AIIB or other sources, will be a part of it.
 
 “But, by far, the biggest investment opportunity is from the private sector again, whether it’s through PPPs [public-private partnerships], institutional investors, IPOs [initial public offerings] or even equity funding – creating an environment which is business and investor-friendly is a big part of capturing the very large amount of additional capital that’s available for investments, inside and outside of China.
 
 “There’s clearly more money out there looking for investment projects than projects that are fundable,” he said.
 
 BRI implementation obstacles in Myanmar
 
 There are two main challenges of implementing the BRI in Myanmar, according to Mr Woetzel. The first one is creating an investor-friendly environment with transparency, the rule of law, stable operating conditions and more.
 
 The second challenge is about human capital.
 
 “If we look at where investments which are made by China, Africa, for example, shows that 80 percent of the employees of Chinese companies in Africa are local. But only 50pc of the managers are local. Clearly, the capacity to develop local managers, and to employ local people, is scaled to the local population.
 
 “That’s going to be the biggest, or second biggest, challenge to sustainable investment flows.
 
 “Engaging the business community, both inside and outside of Myanmar, will be critical to work together with the business community to increase the skills of the local population,” he explained.
 
 What about sending huge numbers of the Chinese workforce to set up and operate projects? He did not think that would be sustainable or feasible financially.
 
 “Unfortunately, I don’t think that it’s a sustainable model. For some things which require large, upfront deployments, such as building a complex steel plant or a one-off capital investment, you could probably send over a workforce to do that, but they would come home again, back to China. Again, with our African research, 80pc of employees are local,” he said.
 
 More significantly, the McKinsey senior partner told The Myanmar Times that the human capital issue poses a bigger challenge than the financial issue and would determine how the country fares compared to the rest of ASEAN.
 
 “Myanmar, given its size, population and proximity, would be very well-positioned to benefit from those investment flows. Whether it in fact it does, depends on the investor-friendly environment and the availability of human capital for support.
 
 “I don’t think financial capital is the big issue here – there’s more than enough money around – but how to put to good use in getting good projects, earn a return, and can be sustainably managed by a local workforce determines how much of that capital actually comes to Myanmar,” he said.
 
 Mr Woetzel also said that the BRI is a multi-decade event and it would take time before the scheme bears fruit in a visible way. Export performance, infrastructure development and household income are important yardsticks by which success could be measured.
 
 “In the short-term, we can start looking at economic activity as indicators – there’s no better indicator than export performance. You can look around the world for BRI countries and see some that are making a lot progress fairly quickly and others which are not so much.
 
 “In addition to the infrastructure investments, we should be able to measure the development of electricity, electrification, road access, the time to market, logistics cost etc.
 
 “Those are the two things that I would look at: export performance and physical progress in infrastructure, and finally also employment,” he said, adding that ultimately people should look at how the local people are benefited from the scheme by indicators such as changes in wages and household income.
 
 Mr Woetzel wrapped up the interview by offering an advice to how the Myanmar government and businesses can capture the opportunity. He again emphasised the importance of having an investor-friendly environment. All in all, the key to securing success in the BRI for Myanmar is not so different from the solutions needed to woo international investors.
 
 “To that point, I think that the government needs to take a clear stance – it’s not enough to say it’s not against business, but to say ‘I am for business’. I think that is required, given the lack of a market and investor-friendly environment.
 
 “There has to be a clear statement of change: ‘Myanmar is open for business’,” he stressed.
 
 The government supporting and actively engaging the investment sector would send a signal to private sector companies to do likewise – that they should be aggressive in reaching out and finding ways to bring in technology, “to modernise their operations to build new distribution channels using the internet, using better factories and better trucks.”
 
 “It is a great opportunity for the people of Myanmar to realise their potential by a new and a more market-driven approach. Other approaches have been tried, but now it is the chance to take a new approach for the Myanmar based on an investor-friendly environment,” he concluded.","['local', 'belt', 'capital', 'investorfriendly', 'initiative', 'woetzel', 'success', 'human', 'bank', 'myanmars', 'myanmar', 'essential', 'road', 'investment', 'environment', 'development', 'infrastructure', 'china', 'bri']","{'China': 14, 'Indonesia': 2, 'Myanmar': 19, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 The Belt and Road Initiative
 
 Launched in 2013 as “One Belt, One Road”, the scheme involves China underwriting billion-dollar investments, mainly in infrastructure, in countries along the old Silk Road and new routes -- linking Asia, Europe and more remote areas in Africa. The financial commitment illustrates the ambition: China is spending roughly US$150 billion a year in the 68 countries which have signed on to the project. The China Development Bank alone has earmarked $890 billion for some 900 projects.
 
 The summit meeting has attracted the largest number of foreign dignitaries to the Chinese capital since the 2008 Olympic Games, and is President Xi’s second international event this year, following his speech against protectionism at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January.
 
 
 
 
 
 Amid all the excitement and fanfare for China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), The Myanmar Times sat down with Bernard Charnwut Chan, president of Asia Financial Holdings and grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, the late founder of Bangkok Bank, to talk about the BRI, its relevance to Myanmar and the region and how Hong Kong can facilitate Sino-ASEAN trade and investments.
 
 Mr Chan is a member of the executive council, the top-level cabinet of the Hong Kong government, as well as a deputy to the Chinese National People’s Congress. He is also chair of Hong Kong-Thailand Business Council and co-president of the Maritime Silk Road Society.
 
 Infrastructure leads to trade and tourism
 
 The Economist Intelligence Unit has described the BRI project as “long on rhetoric and short on implementation, with related economic activity showing little sign of a step change”. In spite of the three years since its launch, Myanmar’s private sector has not witnessed significant changes yet. The China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), for example, has only approved one project in Myanmar so far – the $20 million loan to develop a gas power plant project in Myingyan, Mandalay Region. For Mr Chan, the last three years have been a formation period for China’s state-owned enterprises to prepare for the implementation.
 
 “Clearly, this BRI is a state policy. The fact that it is a state policy has huge implications – not just politically but also economically because many of the Chinese SOEs are very much influenced by state policies,” he said.
 
 After the launch, many SOEs have spent the past three years exploring and investigating how to take advantage of the policy. Because it is a state policy, the Chinese government is offering vast amounts of resources and support for SOEs to develop along the BRI direction.
 
 “For those SOEs that I’m involved in, they all have to look at those BRI opportunities.”
 
 The reach of the BRI is very extensive – more than 60 countries spanning three continents. According to Mr Chan, ASEAN and Myanmar’s geographical proximity to China will create immediate synergy and allow infrastructure projects to take off in the region.
 
 “ASEAN are practically our next-door neighbours. So I suspect ASEAN, for sure, will be a very obvious choice for SOEs to look at. The first wave of these so-called initiatives will be about infrastructure, followed by trade and then other development such as tourism. Infrastructure is the most imminent.
 
 “When SOEs open a map and wonder ‘Well, where do we start? Where do we go?’ I would assume that Myanmar would be a very logical place where these corporations would definitely want to build the connection between China and the area in terms of infrastructure.
 
 “In the last three years, much of BRI has been dealt at the planning stage but now you will start to see more and more Chinese companies locating opportunities in where they can actually find synergy,” he said.
 
 Research conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit suggests that over 60 percent of Chinese overseas direct investment flows to BRI countries in 2013-15 were directed to ASEAN countries.
 
 Different countries have their own advantages, or unique selling points (USPs). For countries with rich natural resources, Chinese energy SOEs would be attracted to venture into the market.
 
 The “overarching strategy” of the BRI, for Mr Chan, is a win-win.
 
 “You can arguably say that it’s a win-win; win for China and win for their counterparts. I’m sure Myanmar and other ASEAN countries would want to be in a partnership with China as well,” he said, adding that, at this level, projects would mainly be infrastructure. Trade and services such as finance, engineering, architecture and insurance will follow.
 
 “This is definitely not a one-year or two-year project, this will likely take a good 15-20 years,” he added.
 
 Gateway between ASEAN and greater China
 
 The executive councillor also reiterated his support for Hong Kong to join the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), citing the reason that it would enhance the city’s competitive advantage and avoid relying exclusively on the mainland. Tax structure and other factors favour Hong Kong firms to expand into the Southeast Asian region.
 
 “I increasingly find that many Chinese companies will prefer to use their subsidiaries in Hong Kong as a gateway to go abroad. For example, Bank of China has decided to use Bank of China Hong Kong as their flagship to go in.
 
 “Those subsidiaries in Hong Kong have far more flexibility to deal with an urgent expansion. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as tax or corporate factors. Being in China, sometimes you have the different reporting regime; but with Hong Kong, we play by international rules. It’s much easier.
 
 “Again, when you deal with partnership, you surely need to figure out which law it is based on – Hong Kong law, Myanmar law or mainland Chinese law. Hong Kong tends to be a place where people generally would favour because it is neutral. The legal system and arbitration here give the assurance to both sides,” he explained.
 
 The city’s participation in the Beijing summit has illustrated its eagerness to take part in the BRI. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying led a 30-strong delegation and also delivered a speech about financial connectivity during a panel discussion. In contrast, China’s decision not to invite Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reflects the tension between the two countries following a few diplomatic fallouts last year.
 
 “Even though, in theory, the BRI is between China and the rest, in practice Hong Kong will be playing a role,” the Chinese congress deputy emphasised once again.
 
 Tackling the “China factor”
 
 Then, there is the “China factor”. For years, the country was Myanmar’s only ally and chief investor, and the then-military regime opened up partly because they did not like China’s monopoly status. Many commentators have argued that China’s role will be crucial for Myanmar’s peace process. But this factor is not only political; it also has enormous economic implications. Ultimately, China would be a vitally important, if not dominant, partner for Myanmar in terms of regional trade and foreign direct investments (FDIs).
 
 The glaring economic asymmetry is conspicuous enough by looking at Yunnan, one of China’s poorer provinces. Its economy is four times bigger than that of Myanmar, its more populous neighbour.
 
 “For any country, you do not want to rely only on one or two trading partners. You would definitely want to expand that reach beyond to hedge your bets. I can see every reason why Myanmar would not want to count on one partner.
 
 “But the fact is that China is China, and it is a huge market. So, whether you like it or not, China will continue to be a major trading partner for the entire region.
 
 “If I were to be the Myanmar government, I would try as much as I could to expand that scope of regional partners, otherwise you’re stuck – you never know if something happens to the Chinese economy. However, to replace China is impossible; China will continue to be a major trading partner for every country in the region because it is a huge market,” Mr Chan said.
 
 And it is not just limited to the market size. Chinese financing is also pivotal for Myanmar’s infrastructure thirst. The region has long suffered from a chronic deficit of infrastructure.
 
 Despite China’s importance, Bernard Chan is confident that the US dollar will remain the leading currency for trade in ASEAN and Myanmar.
 
 “The renminbi will continue to play a significant role, but it will never replace the US dollar. The US dollar is still a major trading currency.
 
 “The most you can do is for Myanmar to use a basket of currency, including the renminbi. But you certainly would not use that to replace the US dollar; it’s just impossible – I don’t think it is technically feasible,” he added.","['countries', 'chinese', 'trade', 'development', 'hong', 'infrastructure', 'soeled', 'china', 'kong', 'enhance', 'bri', 'myanmar', 'soes', 'road']","{'China': 28, 'Hong Kong': 13, 'Myanmar': 17, 'Singapore': 1, 'Thailand': 1, 'United States': 6}",,,,,

It urged foreign businesses to join the game.
 
 
 
 
 
 The report Repaving the Ancient Silk Routes, published by PwC Growth Markets Centre in May, hails the Belt and Road Initiative as “a global game changer”. The report is produced to showcase the opportunities for foreign businesses to be involved in the BRI and the potential risks.
 
 According to the report, the BRI transcended many of its initial impressions and has proven to be much more than offloading industrial surplus or building a road. For example, there is an emphasis on developing bankable infrastructure projects supported by large international agencies, which infers that the BRI goes beyond geopolitics and focuses on trade and investment promotion.
 
 Infrastructure ecosystem
 
 The BRI has included the building of highways, railways, ports, airports and now even attempts to establish a maritime route that cuts through from China to Southeast Asia and beyond.
 
 
 
 
 
 Furthermore, the scheme encompasses the development of an infrastructure ecosystem ranging from power generation and utilities infrastructure, oil and gas pipelines, to telecommunications transmission cables. There will be further activities involving social infrastructure such as education and healthcare, media, software and innovation. The BRI also supports on industrial and resource cooperation to drive trade – 70 cooperative zones have already been set up.
 
 This echoes with what Jonathan Woetzel, McKinsey senior partner and McKinsey Global Institute director, as well as Bernard Chan, president of Asia Financial Holdings and grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, said regarding how the initiative will play out in Myanmar and the region.
 
 Jonathan Woetzel told The Myanmar Times that the private sector and foreign businesses, not multilateral institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, have the biggest part to play.
 
 Similarly, Bernard Chan said services, trade, tourism and other commercial opportunities will follow through after the infrastructure hardware is built. While the physical hardware is led by Chinese state-owned enterprises, the opportunities which come after the infrastructure phase will involve foreign businesses and the private sector.
 
 The report cited a few major achievements in the BRI, including the first China-UK transnational freight train, which completed its 12,450km journey, earlier in January, and the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail project, for which the construction contract was signed in April.
 
 Sino-foreign partnerships
 
 Repaving the ancient Silk Routes argued that partnerships between Chinese organisations and foreign businesses can prove to be beneficial for both sides in many ways. Gaining knowledge through foreign partnerships can help Chinese firms develop expertise, and enhance their credibility in the infrastructure sector. For foreign businesses, collaboration with Chinese companies in infrastructure projects in third party countries can help open up access to its large domestic market.
 
 Foreign businesses can partake as a private investor in projects which are risk-guaranteed by Chinese institutions, according to the report.
 
 “Successful partnership examples already exist, wherein foreign multinationals have become established equipment suppliers to Chinese engineering, procurement and construction [EPC] companies,” it said.
 
 In a typical BRI project, foreign firms are able to contribute by making connections with local stakeholders, as well as having established knowledge of managing an infrastructure project in developing markets. This helps reduce operational risks in a less familiar terrain and business environment.
 
 The authors identified three main areas of risks in the BRI: geopolitical, funding and operational. Geopolitical risks refer to changes in political regimes or in bilateral relations between countries involved in BRI during a project’s life-span. Funding risks mean funding gaps as well as host countries’ varied ability to repay loans, exacerbated by higher capital and debt service ratios of BRI projects. Operational risks are due to a lack of experience in delivering and managing complex transnational projects, leading to delays and cost overruns.
 
 Frank Lyn, markets leader at PwC in China and Hong kong, urged companies to participate at an early stage to reap rewards in the long run.
 
 “In many ways, the initiative serves as a blueprint for how China wants to further connect itself into the global economy and strengthen its influence in the region.
 
 “The initiative .. is a driver for long-term growth and expansion as well as corporate profitability. Therefore, strategically, companies need to be involved at an early stage to reap the long term benefits,” he said.
 
 Joshua Yau, lead principal in Belt and Road at PwC Strategy in China, said that China’s financial prowess would change the game in the process of constructing infrastructure abroad.
 
 “Chinese companies will increasingly bring not only their EPC capabilities, but also their financial prowess to BRI countries,” he explained.
 
 The report concluded that the BRI boasts an unprecedented scale and will drive massive infrastructure spending internationally and create opportunities which warrant foreign businesses to take part. There have already been many success cases of Sino-foreign partnerships which led to increasing demand for foreign capabilities to BRI projects. This, in turn, reaffirms that there are commercial opportunities across the infrastructure value chain.
 
 But the publication cautioned companies against venturing into infrastructure projects without fully understanding the potential risks.
 
 Establishing contingency plans to manage short-term disruptions, planning for lengthy project life-spans and establishing strong relationships with local authorities all help navigate the domestic political and local bureaucratic complications, Repaving the ancient Silk Routes suggested.","['companies', 'projects', 'firm', 'game', 'changer', 'belt', 'chinese', 'opportunities', 'bri', 'infrastructure', 'report', 'foreign', 'risks', 'hails', 'big', 'global', 'road', 'businesses']","{'China': 7, 'Hong Kong': 1, 'Myanmar': 2}",,,,,

Beijing is Myanmar’s key “defender” in the United Nations at a time when the government’s handling of the Rakhine crisis and the recent jailing of two Reuters journalists have eroded its standing in the international community. China currently also accounts for a quarter of all approved foreign investments in the country.
 
 
 
 
 
 In Beijing, the State Counsellor is expected to discuss the highly controversial Myitsone dam project with her Chinese counterparts. The US$3.6 billion, 6000MW dam, backed by China’s State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), was suspended by then-President U Thein Sein in 2011, owing to widespread domestic opposition. Recent developments suggest Daw Suu is under pressure from the Chinese to resuscitate the dam. As I’ve argued, resumption would place her National League for Democracy party at risk in next year’s General Election. Just this week, thousands of people in Kachin’s Waingmaw township protested against Myitsone.
 
 In Bago Region recently, Daw Suu told local residents to think about the project from “a wider perspective.” She should explain what she meant by that, and say what other factors are taken into account.
 
 For starters, transparency is essential. For example, officials of SPIC have been urging the Myanmar government to publicly disclose details of the Myitsone contract since June 2016. And this is not the only enterprise which needs to come clean.
 
 With the exception of Serge Pun’s Yangon “new city” scheme, none of the major projects involving Chinese players have been transparent. These include the grand China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), Kyaukphyu deep-sea port, Kachin’s border economic zone and mega industrial park, among others.
 
 
 
 
 
 Parliamentary consent for such projects is necessary. Article 46 of the 2017 Investment law stipulates that for “investment businesses which may have a significant impact on security, economic condition, the environment, and national interest”, the government should seek approval of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw before signing the deal. To date, the administration has not implemented this clause.
 
 If there were to be a new agreement on Myitsone, Kyaukphyu and the aforementioned projects, they should be referred to Parliament for approval upon conclusion of negotiations. This requires the contract to be made public once it has been agreed in principle by the two sides, subject to parliamentary consent. Securing the legislature’s sanction is a source of reassurance to investors as well, as the risk of public challenge and renegotiation by subsequent administrations is reduced.
 
 In addition, Article 45 of Investment Rules requires all investment proposal summaries to be published on the government website “within 10 working days after the date of receipt for public information”. The government has not enforced this provision yet.
 
 The authorities must also comply with Article 5 of the 2015 Protection of the Rights of National Races Law. It provides that “indigenous peoples” should receive “complete and precise information” about business activities in their areas before implementation, for ethnic groups to negotiate with the government and project proponents.
 
 Meanwhile, the 2015 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedures instruct companies to undertake social and environmental studies and community consultations.
 
 Failure to adhere to these laws have hurt communities and contributed to resentment against Chinese enterprises and the Chinese people.
 
 While irresponsible developers and investors make money at the expense of local communities, the businesses are done on Myanmar soil under Myanmar sovereignty. It is therefore the duty of the Myanmar government to ensure that investments are made responsibly. At the same time, sound economic governance can go a long way to help ensure the Belt and Road Initiative and its massive investments ultimately benefit the people of Myanmar.
 
 Properly scrutinised and effectively regulated, Chinese involvement in the country could be a key driver for reform and competition. Myanmar can learn from the successes and lessons across the border to grow and modernise and stands to benefit directly from the connectivity and investment.
 
 In the end, Beijing has a strategic need for good relations with Myanmar. The oil and gas pipelines connecting Kyaukphyu and Yunnan as well as the gateway to the Bay of Bengal are essential to its energy security. Naturally, Big Brother wants to be welcomed in, not force itself through the door.
 
 That is why, rather than being on the receiving end, the State Counsellor should set out her vision of the future “pauk-hpaw” (Sino-Myanmar) relationship. Above all, she needs stand by her pledge that the Myitsone contract will be made public and tell China that Myanmar’s legislature simply will have none of it.","['state', 'projects', 'firm', 'weakened', 'talks', 'chinese', 'public', 'investment', 'economic', 'stand', 'myitsone', 'myanmar', 'project', 'needs', 'suu']","{'China': 4, 'Myanmar': 12, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi meets with residents of Htamanthi village in Sagaing Region’s Homalin Township on Friday. / Myanmar State Counselor’s Office / Facebook
 
 YANGON—Amid increasing pressure from China to resume the controversial Myitsone Dam project, the State Counselor has promised that her government will make a final decision on the dam based upon political, economic and environmental considerations, and vowed to make public the details of the decision.
 
 When asked her opinion of the Myitsone Dam project at a meeting with local residents in Pyay, Bago Region on Thursday, State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said, “I would like you to think [about the project] from a wider perspective.”
 
 She said, “We should not think based on one perspective. If we think from only one perspective, we could make the wrong [decision].”
 
 The State Counselor said the final decision would have to be politically, socially, economically and environmentally sound and sustainable.
 
 Daw Aung San Suu Kyi did not offer her own stance on whether the dam project should be scrapped, nor did she say when a decision would be made.
 
 However, she said her government should not abolish projects approved by a previous government just because it did not comply with the current administration’s policies.
 
 If government of the day were to break promises made by previous governments, the country would lose credibility, she said.
 
 She added that her government would make decisions transparently, not only when it comes to the Myitsone project, but also on other projects.
 
 The proposed US$3.6-billion (approximately 5.48 trillion kyats) Myitsone Dam is one of seven hydropower projects planned for the upper reaches of the Irrawaddy River as well as the Mali and N’Mai rivers, at whose confluence the Irrawaddy begins. Work on the project started in 2009, but then-President Thein Sein suspended it in 2011 amid widespread public concern over the dam’s social and environmental impacts.
 
 Experts point out that the dam site is important for its biodiversity, and environmentalists warn the project would both destroy the natural beauty of the Irrawaddy River and disrupt water flow downstream.
 
 The project remains in limbo. After the National League for Democracy took power in 2016, the government set up a 20-member commission including the chief minister of Kachin to review the project, including its environmental and social impacts. The commission has produced two reports to date, but the government has yet to release either.
 
 Recently, Chinese officials strongly pressured Kachin political and religious leaders on the need to restart the Myitsone project, saying it was an important part of China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Initiative.
 
 In late January, Investment and Foreign Economic Relations Minister U Thaung Tun said at a press conference the government is working hard to come up with a final decision on how to proceed with the controversial Myitsone Dam project. The minister said the government and a commission studying the project are in very serious discussions and considering all possibilities, including downsizing the dam, relocating it or developing other projects instead.
 
 U Thaung Tun said the China-backed project is dogged by major problems and has received nationwide pushback. He said the dam project as it was initially conceived under the previous government was “misguided”.
 
 Many experts believe the Myanmar government needs to a make final decision on Myitsone before Daw Aung San Suu Kyi visits Beijing to attend a BRI forum in April. She is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the forum.","['wider', 'state', 'kyi', 'repeats', 'decision', 'perspective', 'dam', 'final', 'san', 'project', 'counselor', 'myitsone', 'suu']","{'China': 3, 'Mali': 2, 'Myanmar': 2, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 Xi’s arrival was greeted with dancing children and youths waving the national flags of both countries and cheering, “Long live China-Myanmar friendship” and “Health to President Xi.”
 
 China’s ambassador to Myanmar, Chen Hai, told Chinese journalists last week that during Xi’s two-day visit, the two countries would sign agreements “covering politics, economy, livelihoods and regional cooperation.” Some are expected to expedite major infrastructure projects that will extend Beijing's strategic presence to the Indian Ocean.
 
 A complicating factor is Myanmar's general election, scheduled for late 2020. Too much wheeling and dealing with China could leave the government of the de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, vulnerable to accusations by political opponents that it is selling out the country.
 
 The trip is Xi ‘s first to Myanmar as president and his first foreign visit this year. Jiang Zemin was the last Chinese president to visit Myanmar, when he signed several economic and border agreements in 2001.
 
 
 
 
 
 Chen, the ambassador, said Xi will meet with Myanmar’s President Win Myint, State Counselor Suu Kyi and military chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, lawmakers and other opinion-makers.
 
 Myanmar is a linchpin of China’s geopolitical ambitions. It offers access to the Indian Ocean that could allow its sizable oil and gas imports from the Persian Gulf to bypass going through the Strait of Malacca. It's also a bridge to South Asia and beyond in Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative to build railroads, highways, ports and other infrastructure connecting China with other points in Asia, Europe and Africa.
 
 China serves as a no-questions-asked ally to Myanmar, giving it diplomatic cover as the country faces widespread condemnation over its human rights record. It is threatened with Western economic sanctions over a brutal counterinsurgency campaign that has driven more than 700,000 members of the country's Northern Rakhine Muslim a minority to flee for safety in neighbouring Bangladesh.
 
 Last month a case charging Myanmar with genocide came before the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands.
 
 China for years has defended Myanmar in forums such as the United Nations, and Myanmar has returned the favour by following Beijing's positions on issue such as China’s claims over territory in the South China Sea.
 
 More importantly, China as a top investor and trade partner with Myanmar offers economic insurance if Western nations do impose sanctions.
 
 Just days before Suu Kyi went to The Hague in December to lead her country’s delegation at the initial hearings of the International Court of Justice, she met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The court holds another hearing next week.
 
 “Xi is visiting Myanmar at the very right time. And Myanmar wants to show the Western world that China is backing them,” Germany-based activist Nay San Lwin told The Associated Press. ""I think it is not a coincidence. Myanmar wanted to say to the West to be careful if you impose any sanctions.""
 
 Beijing in recent years has vied with Washington for influence in Southeast Asia.
 
 China also uses its influence with various Myanmar ethnic rebel groups based along the countries' border who are battling battle for autonomy from the central government.
 
 While China has promoted peace talks between the the rebels and Myanmar's government, its close ties with some of the rebel groups allow it to retain the option of threatening violence by using ethnic guerrillas as proxies.
 
 What appears to be a mutually beneficial quid pro quo with China won’t necessarily play well domestically, a worry for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her ruling National League for Democracy party as it faces new elections. A longstanding, strong undercurrent of anti-Chinese sentiment in Myanmar has grown in response to sometimes heavy-handed implementation of Chinese-backed projects that run roughshod over local communities, provoking allegations of land-grabbing, environmental damage and selling out the country's resources.
 
 Myanmar's previous military-backed government was forced by popular demand to suspend plans for the massive $3.6 billion Myitsone hydroelectric dam project in 2011, but it has not been canceled. Activists plan a protest against the project on Saturday outside the Chinese Embassy in Yangon.
 
 Hurdles may be cleared during Xi’s visit to give the go-ahead to another project arguably more important to Beijing, the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone on the Bay of Bengal. With a deep-water port, it is the terminus of the 1,700-kilometer- (1,055-mile-) long China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, a major link in the Belt and Road Initiative whose other end is in China's Yunnan province.
 
 It includes cross-border oil and gas pipelines that have been operating for years. An industrial park and major railway are planned, though projected high costs have given pause.
 
 Amnesty International is among the critics of the Chinese-assisted projects.
 
 “With major economic and infrastructure agreements expected to be signed during President Xi’s visit, the absolute lack of transparency over such agreements is deeply disturbing,” the human rights group said in a statement Thursday. “Investment in infrastructure can help raise living standards and realize human rights through improved access to basic services and employment.”
 
 “But these benefits are not delivered if those who bear the heaviest cost — the women, men, and children whose homes, health, livelihoods are be affected — are not adequately consulted before construction starts and protected from potential harm. Human rights, transparency, and consultation with communities should be at the heart of these projects.”","['rolls', 'visit', 'kyi', 'red', 'jinping', 'chinese', 'myanmar', 'major', 'economic', 'infrastructure', 'president', 'china', 'rights', 'carpet', 'xi', 'suu']","{'Bangladesh': 1, 'China': 18, 'Germany': 1, 'India': 2, 'Myanmar': 21, 'Netherlands': 1}",,,,,

 Surrounded by superb natural conditions, the Kyaukpyu deep-water port in the western Rakhine State of Myanmar, is set to become another model project under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) framework, benefiting both Myanmar and China.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 NAY PYI TAW, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Along the Bay of Bengal on the west tip of Myanmar, the town of Kyaukpyu in Rakhine State sits tranquilly on a 25-meter deep harbor.
 
 This deep-sea port, surrounded by superb natural conditions, could be developed into another demonstration project under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), mutually benefiting both Myanmar and China.
 
 During Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to Myanmar on Jan. 17-18, the two sides agreed to strengthen their BRI cooperation, and work hard to push forward the construction of the Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ), according to a joint statement issued by the two countries on Saturday.
 
 
 
 
 
 MASTER PLAN
 
 In 2014, the Myanmar government invited bidders from around the world for its plan to set up the Kyaukpyu SEZ, one of the country's three national SEZs, in an effort to kick-start the local economy and raise living standards.
 
 The master plan includes a deep-sea port and an accompanying industrial park nearby.

 In 2015, a consortium of six companies led by the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) won the tender for building the Kyaukpyu SEZ. Three years later, after a marathon of negotiations, the CITIC-led consortium struck a framework agreement with Myanmar on the project.
 
 
 
 Port development is divided into four phases, according to the CITIC Group, and the first stage involves the construction of two berths with a total investment of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. The construction of the port will soon commence after completing economic and social impact assessments.
 
 With the newly reached consensus, the Kyaukpyu port project should pick up pace, raising hopes the project will substantially transform the economic landscape of the township and inject fresh vitality into Myanmar's drive for sustainable development and prosperity for its people.
 
 The CITIC consortium told Xinhua that the port and the industrial park combined will create more than 100,000 jobs each year for local residents and create tax revenues of 15 billon dollars during the initial franchise period of 50 years.

 BRI WIN-WIN
 
 More than six years after China first put forward the BRI, a grand undertaking to build a trade and infrastructure network linking Asia with Europe, Africa and beyond, the Kyaukpyu deep-water port will join the ever-expanding list of BRI projects.
 
 In fact, the port is not only a pivotal point in the ""Y""-shaped China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, but also a key project that is win-win in nature in the global blueprint of BRI cooperation.

 The multi-purpose container port, if completed, is expected to improve transport and logistics, strengthen inter-connectivity and spur the local economy.
 
 The deep-water harbor will help China, Myanmar and other countries enhance trade and play an important role in accelerating regional economic integration.
 
 ""With the Kyaukpyu project and the building of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, Myanmar can embrace new development opportunities. It's a win-win affair,"" said Hu Biliang, executive dean of the Belt and Road School at Beijing Normal University.
 
 The Kyaukpyu SEZ project could consolidate trade and economic ties between Myanmar and China's southwest region, push for stronger cooperation in capacity building, and facilitate the development of an export-oriented economy in southwest China.
 
 
 
 
 
 HIGH EXPECTATIONS
 
 Although construction has yet to begin, residents in the town have expressed support for the project, and the hope for more jobs, higher incomes and better lives.

 ""Many people in Rakhine State have left to other cities or gone abroad for work due to lack of jobs here,"" and creating more work is the only way to bring them back and help revive the local economy, said Nyeinn Chann Maung, who owns a hotel in Kyaukpyu and is chairman of Kyaukpyu District Native Ethnic Development Association.
 
 ""We face transport difficulties, power shortages, and we don't have a big market, so building only one or two factories alone cannot change the game,"" he told Xinhua. ""That's why we need a large-scale special economic zone.""
 
 ""We have been looking forward to this project for quite a long time, like people in dire need of water yearning for a timely rain,"" he said. ""With this visit of the Chinese leader, we feel we finally have that long-awaited rain.""
 
 Tun Nu, chairman of a local elders' association made up of 18 respected people from various sectors, voiced his hope for launching the Kyaukpyu SEZ as soon as possible.

 ""This is a poverty-stricken area, and we want this project to push for development,"" he said.
 
 The 72-year-old said the deep-sea port would not only boost living standards but provide a growth engine for the local economy.
 
 Kyaw Kyaw Soe, an entrepreneur who has helped build China-Myanmar oil and gas pipelines, showed strong interest in the port project, saying ""We wish to join the project because we want to share the development dividends.""
 
 Such a huge investment is bound to instill vitality into local development and push up the gross domestic product of the region, he said.
 
 
 
 
 
 FOSTERING TALENT
 
 Because Kyaukpyu remains underdeveloped, young people have little opportunity to receive a higher education. They either fish for a living or opt to work elsewhere. To help equip young people with more practical skills, the CITIC consortium has set up a training center.

 The first training program, which began in September last year and lasted two months, provided English-language and power engineering courses. The second program designed to teach Chinese is now underway.
 
 Aye Thandar Linn, who is learning Chinese at the center, is an associate professor at the Government Technical Institute in Kyaukpyu, which focuses on training young talent for the Kyaukpyu SEZ.
 
 ""It will be much easier for me to communicate with Chinese enterprises in the future if I can speak Chinese, when the special economic zone is completed,"" she said.
 
 ""I also hope mastering Chinese can enable me to get more opportunities for my students, for them to work in Chinese companies,"" Aye said. ""My expectation is that our graduates land good jobs because of the deep-sea port.""

 The Chinese “project of the century” — the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is a transcontinental network of roads, railways and ports, covering dams, mines and pipelines is causing major environmental deterioration in Myanmar. The BRI has profound consequences, involving soil contamination and erosion, air pollution, water pollution, habitat and wildlife loss. Some projects have been stalled due to local opposition, however it won’t be for long before China resumes these projects. Local activists in few instances have also been arrested and suppressed by the central government of Myanmar.
 
 Myanmar, also known as Suvarnabhumi in Sanskrit (Golden Land), has been famous for its natural resources since ancient times. The raw materials include oil, gas, minerals, timber, forest products and hydropower potential. China since 2010 has been casting its eyes on Myanmar’s rich natural resources for commercial exploitation. The issues of Myitsone dam project, Letpadaung copper mine project and Kyaukpyu port in Myanmar have been elaborated in detail below, highlighting China’s continuous defence of its wrongdoings in Naypyidaw.
 
 Myitsone dam project
 
 The construction of a huge hydroelectric dam at Myitsone, Myanmar, by a state-owned Chinese company began in 2009. Myitsone is a geographically strategic location where two rivers N’mai Hka and Mali Hka converge to form the Irrawaddy, the largest waterway in Myanmar. The Chinese plan was to tap Myanmar’s vast hydro resources from Irrawaddy and Salween. The $3.6 billion dam project instead of benefitting Myanmar which was electricity deprived, will export 90% of the electricity to China.
 
 A report by China Power Investment Corporation (covering 80% of the project cost) highlighted the possibilities of the disruption of river flow, disappearance of a migratory fish species and flooding of 26,238 hectares of rainforests. They did not plan to make the report public, however, against their will a copy of it got leaked to environmentalists and opponents of the dam, thereby stirring protests in 2011.

 People gathered in masses in a park in Myitkyina township in Kachin state calling for a complete halt to the Myitsone project. One of the protest leaders, U Sar Chi, said “…that dam is not for us. We support the free flow of the Ayeyarwady. We can’t accept implementing the project without the people’s will.”
 
 In a successful win for civil society groups, the Myanmar government suspended the project in September 2011. However, Beijing has frequently pressurised the Kachin leaders for the resumption of the Myitsone dam project as it is essential to implement Xi’s BRI. Despite, Xi’s visit in early 2020 to Myanmar, China couldn’t succeed in reviving the project. However, Aung San Suu Kyi since becoming the defacto government in 2015 has spoken in favour of the project reversing her previous stance of opposing the dam when she was in the opposition party.
 
 Letpadaung copper mine
 
 Chinese company, Wanbao Mining Copper Ltd in 2011 formed a partnership with Myanmar’s military associated Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited to take control of the operations of Leptadaung copper mine.
 
 However, the expansion of the mine involved the unlawful confiscation of thousands of acres of farmers’ land. Provisions were made to compensate the farmers in part with 1,900 acres of vacant land from nearby villages, howbeit the new plots of land handed to them were infertile and located far from their villages.
 
 The local residents staged protests in 2011 but it was met with police brutality. The standoff escalated in 2012 when the police used grenades to disperse protests causing chemical burns to a large crowd of people.
 
 [pullquote] In 2017, Amnesty International in a report stated that the project was “plagued by human rights abuses” and urged the Myanmar government to suspend the operations. [/pullquote]
 
 Amid these protests the project was eventually suspended and an investigation committee was led by the then opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The report acknowledged the non-conduct of environment and social assessment, nevertheless advised to continue the project on economic grounds.
 
 In 2017, Amnesty International in a report stated that the project was “plagued by human rights abuses” and urged the Myanmar government to suspend the operations. One of the residents of Sete village, Yi Yi Win, in an interview with Frontier Myanmar stated that the people who lost their lands were still not being compensated and the waste overspill from the mine had completed destroyed the remaining fields.
 
 Kyaukpyu port
 
 Kyaukpyu a coastal town along the Bay of Bengal in Myanmar is valuable to China for strategic and economic reasons. This town is the terminal point of China’s $1.5 billion oil pipeline and a parallel natural gas pipeline running till the China’s Yunnan province.
 
 China National Petroleum Corporation and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, state owned firms constructed these pipelines between 2010 and 2015. The gas pipeline entered operation in 2013 capable of sending 12 billion cubic meters of gas to China annually, and the oil pipeline finally entered operation in 2017 capable of carrying roughly 22 million barrels of oil annually. Thus providing China with an alternative route for energy imports from the Middle East, thereby avoiding the chokepoint of Malacca Strait pipeline.
 
 Furthermore, in 2018 China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) leading a consortium of six companies struck a framework agreement with Myanmar on building the Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ). In the same year, Myanmar signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China to establish the China Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC). This 1,700 km long corridor connects China’s Yunnan province to Myanmar’s major economic centers from Mandalay in central Myanmar, to Yangon in south and the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in west. Hence, the Kyaukpyu deep water port is connected to China’s larger Belt and Road Initiative in Myanmar. Yet again arousing fears of Chinese unobstructed economic leverage over Myanmar. The Myanmar government’s 30 percent stake in the project is around $2.2 billion, if it occupies 50 percent stake then it would amount to almost 5% of Myanmar’s GDP, thereby forcing it to rely on Chinese loans. Another crucial concern to the activists was the human rights violations caused during project implementation such as forced relocation of more than 20,000 Rakhine residents and dictated militarisation.

 The governments of small countries like Myanmar are thirsty for investments despite instances of dispossession, exploitation of natural resources and environmental damage by Beijing’s BRI project. A study ‘Greening the Belt and Road Initiative’ by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) revealed that the BRI corridor will affect around 265 threatened species, 1,739 important bird areas and 46 biodiversity hotspots. Hydropower projects backed by China along the Mekong river running through Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam is said to highly disrupt the river flow and create a loss of about one million tons of fish every year. Deforestation in areas such as the Pan Borneo Highway that traverses Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei will make it susceptible to landslides, floods, and other disaster related concerns.
 
 China’s BRI, one of the largest infrastructure undertakings will bring unprecedented economic and environmental shifts. The impact of the project on environment has received negligible attention. The environmental concerns are legitimate and there is very less precedence for analysing and planning the environmental impacts of massive projects at the scale of BRI. Hence, the governments despite their quest for investment must take decisions keeping social and environmental impacts in mind before it gets too late to act.

 CITIC Group Corporation, the Chinese state firm leading the project, started this month a legally required environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) and preliminary geological survey, the first signs of on-the-ground progress for the mega-project.
 
 The moves come eight months after Aung San Suu Kyi’s civilian government inked a framework agreement with a CITIC-led consortium. The agreement fell short of, but paved the way for, an actual concession-granting deal.
 
 The CITIC-led consortium, comprised of four other Chinese enterprises and Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group, aims to develop the port as part of a special economic zone (SEZ) in Myanmar’s conflict-ridden Rakhine state.
 
 Negotiations for the mega-project, green-lighted by previous president Thein Sein, stalled in the first two years of Suu Kyi’s government, either for reasons of red tape or lingering official unease over the scheme.
 
 When contacted by Asia Times, a CITIC representative declined to speculate on when the two parties would conclude the ongoing talks.

 Last year, the National League for Democracy-led government renegotiated the port’s consortium-government share-holding ratio down from 85:15 to 70:30, while shaving the project’s total cost from $7.5 billion to $1.3 billion.
 
 The project’s original $7.5 billion price tag was criticized last year as “crazy” by Suu Kyi’s economic advisor Sean Turnell, an Australian academic and expert on Myanmar’s financial system.
 
 Turnell warned of a possible debt trap scenario akin to Sri Lanka’s China-financed Hambantota port, which saw the state give Beijing a 99-year lease for the facility in exchange for debt relief.
 
 With the Kyaukphyu port project’s cost slashed by over $6 billion, the NLD government now claims it will not become a sovereignty-eroding debt burden. But there are other complicating factors.
 
 For one, Rakhine state’s Rohingya refugee crisis has severely strained relations with the West, with the European Union now considering whether to withdraw Myanmar’s special trade privileges.
 
 That’s reaffirmed China’s position as the country’s indispensable partner, accounting for around a quarter of total approved foreign investments. However, Chinese outlays, as with many mega-projects in Myanmar, have been attended by controversy.

 Beijing’s recent efforts to restart the $3.8 billion Myitsone dam, designed to export as much as 90% of its power to China, have been met with a backlash, while Yangon’s China-backed “new city” scheme has come under fire for lacking an open tender process.
 
 Kyaukphyu faces similar risks of a backlash, analysts say. Yuan Shaobin, CITIC Myanmar’s executive president, said in 2017 that the just commenced ESIA process would take at least 1.5 years, meaning the earliest actual construction could start would be in early 2021.
 
 Experts already foresee potential legal snags.
 
 If CITIC’s plan relates to only the port without an SEZ, then the current Kyaukphyu SEZ authority in charge must transfer oversight responsibilities to the Myanmar Investment Commission, according to Sean Bain, legal adviser to the International Commission of Jurists.
 
 “On the other hand, if an SEZ remains part of the plans for Kyaukphyu, any environmental impact assessment must be site-wide, incorporating all aspects of the project from the seaport to the industrial zones and the envisaged industries,” he added.
 
 Bain says the announced assessment appears to only concern the port, which would fail to examine the cumulative environmental and human rights impacts of a wider project that includes a SEZ.
 
 “The confusion highlights the ongoing lack of transparency about these projects,” Bain said.
 
 In recent months, Suu Kyi has called for more investment in Rakhine state and pushed to improve the coastal region’s infrastructure, including through the financial support of local tycoons with ties to the previous military regime.

 Rakhine’s poverty rate is significantly higher than the national average despite its abundance of resources including untapped stores of natural gas. Deep-rooted political and security issues have undercut the state’s economic progress.
 
 More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled northern Rakhine for Bangladesh since 2017 following a controversial military clampdown in response to attacks by the upstart, insurgent Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.
 
 The United Nations has said the military campaign was disproportionate and may have had “genocidal intent”, a charge Myanmar authorities have steadfastly denied but one that could eventually lead to punitive new sanctions.
 
 The Kyaukphyu port project’s proponents argue that it will provide much-needed infrastructure and jobs in an impoverished region which otherwise struggles to attract business and investment.
 
 China’s motivations for Kyaukphyu, to be sure, are as geo-strategic as they are economic. The area houses terminals for twin oil and gas pipelines that extend across Myanmar into China’s landlocked southwestern Yunnan province.
 
 If built, the port will give China strategic access to the Indian Ocean via the Bay of Bengal, reducing its reliance and vulnerability to maritime trade that currently passes through the narrow and congested Strait of Malacca.

 It would also have significant economic upshots for China, according to Mekong Economics country representative in Myanmar Sten te Vogt.
 
 The facility will potentially cut costs and save time for China’s trade with South Asia, the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere. That depends, however, on the development of supporting transport infrastructure, including connecting rail lines.
 
 Myanmar’s transport ministry is now mulling the feasibility of a proposed $9 billion railway linking the central city of Mandalay to the northern border town of Muse, which is situated across from the Chinese town of Ruili.
 
 Myanma Railways expects the Kunming-Ruili railway, which is now under construction and is designed to connect to the Muse-Mandalay route, to be completed by 2021.
 
 Still, potential controversy abounds. A now-disbanded commission on Rakhine state’s problems led by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan recommended a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) for Kyaukphyu before the project proceeds.
 
 The commission recommended that the SEA probe in particular how the China-backed scheme and other policies would impact the local environment and communities, and assess how other industries may be affected by the project.
 
 Past investments in Kyaukphyu – and Myanmar more broadly – suggest significant risks with only limited upside for trickle down economic benefits for local communities, the commission report warned.

 China’s pipeline project, for instance, sparked local tensions over land grabs, insufficient compensation for damages, environmental degradation and an influx of foreign workers that took construction jobs from locals.
 
 Suu Kyi publicly endorsed and promised to implement the commission’s recommendations, including a SEA for Kyaukphyu’s port.
 
 “It is critically important that an SEA be done first [before the ESIA],” said commission member Laetitia van den Assum, a retired Dutch diplomat. “It is much broader in scope than an ESIA and provides both immediate and longer-term benefits.
 
 “Merely looking at Kyaukpyu port itself and not considering many of the factors that define the much larger area around it and the communities that call it home is asking for trouble,” she told Asia Times.
 
 “Unless the government recognizes the urgent necessity to develop and implement a comprehensive plan for the future of Rakhine state and all its people, the tensions will persist.”

 The initial $7.3 billion price tag on the Kyauk Pyu deepwater port, on the western tip of Myanmar’s conflict-torn Rakhine state, set off alarm bells due to reports of troubled Chinese-backed projects in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the official and the advisor said.
 
 Deputy Finance Minister Set Aung, who was appointed to lead project negotiations in May, told Reuters the “project size has been tremendously scaled down”.
 
 The revised cost would be “around $1.3 billion, something that’s much more plausible for Myanmar’s use”, said Sean Turnell, economic advisor to Myanmar’s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.
 
 China’s state-run CITIC Group [CITIC.UL], the main developer of the project, said negotiations were ongoing and that the $1.3 billion was to be spent on the “initial phase” of the port, adding the project was divided into four phases. It did not elaborate on plans for subsequent stages.
 
 A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Monday that “according to what I understand, at present both sides are having commercial negotiations” on the Kyauk Pyu project.
 
 “The talks are progressing,” Geng said at a foreign ministry briefing in Beijing. He referred further questions to the companies involved.
 
 The original plan was to develop around 10 berths at the 25-metre deep sea port to accommodate bigger oil tankers, but the size will now be revised to only two berths, Set Aung said in an interview.
 
 He declined to elaborate on other specifications, citing ongoing technical discussions.
 
 The Kyauk Pyu port is a key part of China’s ambitious Belt and Road initiative, aimed at expanding trade links across the world. While Beijing says Belt and Road is mutually beneficial for it and its partners, questions have been raised about countries taking on excessive debt to build projects.
 
 In Myanmar, the government faces a delicate balancing act in renegotiating the project with China, analysts say.
 
 The country is increasingly reliant on diplomatic support from Beijing as it faces Western criticism over its treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rakhine state, and needs Beijing’s help to end ethnic conflicts on its borders. But many in Myanmar are also wary of becoming too dependent on China.
 
 “There is a strong current of opinion that is nervous about becoming overreliant on China,” said Richard Horsey, a former U.N. diplomat and a Yangon-based political analyst. “That debate is playing out within the government.”
 
 DEBT FEARS
 
 Beijing has pushed for strategic opportunities in Myanmar, including preferential access to the Kyauk Pyu port, after being driven to all but abandon a hydroelectric project in the country amid widespread local opposition last year.
 
 Kyauk Pyu is an entry point for a 770-kilometre (480-mile) pipeline delivering oil and natural gas to China’s Yunnan province. That gives China an alternative route for energy imports from the Middle East that avoids the strategic chokepoint of the Malacca Strait.
 
 Under the original plan, Kyauk Pyu would have had a container capacity to rival that of ports such as Manila or Valencia in Spain.
 
 Construction on the port, and an accompanying special economic zone, which together were supposed to cost up to $10 billion, was expected to start in 2018. A 4,200-acre industrial park worth $2.3 billion was planned to attract textile and oil refining industries.
 
 But Myanmar officials said the experience of Sri Lanka, where this year the government signed over to China the lease on a strategic port to pay off Chinese-backed loans used to finance it, had raised concerns the country could be walking into a debt trap.
 
 The new deal “reduces the financial risk dramatically” and shows that “concerns about indebtedness and sovereignty have been and can be addressed”, said Turnell, an Australian economist. “This really could become a constructive model for countries that don’t have much leverage over a giant like China.”
 
 Set Aung, the deputy finance minister, said Myanmar would give no sovereign guarantees for any loans financing the project.
 
 He added that the project’s timeline was likely to be delayed several months as Myanmar was looking to hire an international consulting firm to review costs.
 
 “The new deal ensures that any loans financing this project will not lead back to the Myanmar government but rather they will all be private,” he said. “At the moment, my priority is to ensure there is no debt burden for the Myanmar government and these concerns are now quite limited.”
 
 CITIC said the two sides had not discussed hiring a third party company to audit the project.
 
 “START SMALL”
 
 Myanmar government officials said their Chinese counterparts had been “amenable” to renegotiating and had agreed in principle to the new deal, but had yet to sign off.
 
 CITIC won a tender in 2015 to develop the project from the previous military-backed government. Set Aung, the deputy finance minister, said disagreements emerged over terms and conditions after the initial tender had been awarded.
 
 “The previous government wanted to go big, whereas we want to start small and expand only if there is demand for it,” he said.
 
 When asked about the accompanying special economic zone, both Turnell and Set Aung said any expansion plans would depend on the port’s viability.
 
 “Each stage has to demonstrate feasibility before the next phase can be rolled out,” Turnell said.","['aung', 'port', 'debt', 'set', 'pyu', 'turnell', 'finance', 'exclusive', 'billion', 'scales', 'chinesebacked', 'kyauk', 'myanmar', 'official', 'project', 'fears']","{'Australia': 1, 'China': 9, 'Spain': 1, 'Sri Lanka': 2, 'Myanmar': 13, 'Pakistan': 1}",,,,,

 The Chinese “project of the century” — the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is a transcontinental network of roads, railways and ports, covering dams, mines and pipelines is causing major environmental deterioration in Myanmar. The BRI has profound consequences, involving soil contamination and erosion, air pollution, water pollution, habitat and wildlife loss. Some projects have been stalled due to local opposition, however it won’t be for long before China resumes these projects. Local activists in few instances have also been arrested and suppressed by the central government of Myanmar.
 
 Myanmar, also known as Suvarnabhumi in Sanskrit (Golden Land), has been famous for its natural resources since ancient times. The raw materials include oil, gas, minerals, timber, forest products and hydropower potential. China since 2010 has been casting its eyes on Myanmar’s rich natural resources for commercial exploitation. The issues of Myitsone dam project, Letpadaung copper mine project and Kyaukpyu port in Myanmar have been elaborated in detail below, highlighting China’s continuous defence of its wrongdoings in Naypyidaw.
 
 Myitsone dam project
 
 The construction of a huge hydroelectric dam at Myitsone, Myanmar, by a state-owned Chinese company began in 2009. Myitsone is a geographically strategic location where two rivers N’mai Hka and Mali Hka converge to form the Irrawaddy, the largest waterway in Myanmar. The Chinese plan was to tap Myanmar’s vast hydro resources from Irrawaddy and Salween. The $3.6 billion dam project instead of benefitting Myanmar which was electricity deprived, will export 90% of the electricity to China.
 
 A report by China Power Investment Corporation (covering 80% of the project cost) highlighted the possibilities of the disruption of river flow, disappearance of a migratory fish species and flooding of 26,238 hectares of rainforests. They did not plan to make the report public, however, against their will a copy of it got leaked to environmentalists and opponents of the dam, thereby stirring protests in 2011.
 
 [pullquote] Beijing has frequently pressurised the Kachin leaders for the resumption of the Myitsone dam project as it is essential to implement Xi’s BRI. [/pullquote]
 
 People gathered in masses in a park in Myitkyina township in Kachin state calling for a complete halt to the Myitsone project. One of the protest leaders, U Sar Chi, said “…that dam is not for us. We support the free flow of the Ayeyarwady. We can’t accept implementing the project without the people’s will.”
 
 In a successful win for civil society groups, the Myanmar government suspended the project in September 2011. However, Beijing has frequently pressurised the Kachin leaders for the resumption of the Myitsone dam project as it is essential to implement Xi’s BRI. Despite, Xi’s visit in early 2020 to Myanmar, China couldn’t succeed in reviving the project. However, Aung San Suu Kyi since becoming the defacto government in 2015 has spoken in favour of the project reversing her previous stance of opposing the dam when she was in the opposition party.
 
 Letpadaung copper mine
 
 Chinese company, Wanbao Mining Copper Ltd in 2011 formed a partnership with Myanmar’s military associated Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited to take control of the operations of Leptadaung copper mine.
 
 However, the expansion of the mine involved the unlawful confiscation of thousands of acres of farmers’ land. Provisions were made to compensate the farmers in part with 1,900 acres of vacant land from nearby villages, howbeit the new plots of land handed to them were infertile and located far from their villages.
 
 The local residents staged protests in 2011 but it was met with police brutality. The standoff escalated in 2012 when the police used grenades to disperse protests causing chemical burns to a large crowd of people.
 
 [pullquote] In 2017, Amnesty International in a report stated that the project was “plagued by human rights abuses” and urged the Myanmar government to suspend the operations. [/pullquote]
 
 Amid these protests the project was eventually suspended and an investigation committee was led by the then opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The report acknowledged the non-conduct of environment and social assessment, nevertheless advised to continue the project on economic grounds.
 
 In 2017, Amnesty International in a report stated that the project was “plagued by human rights abuses” and urged the Myanmar government to suspend the operations. One of the residents of Sete village, Yi Yi Win, in an interview with Frontier Myanmar stated that the people who lost their lands were still not being compensated and the waste overspill from the mine had completed destroyed the remaining fields.
 
 Kyaukpyu port
 
 Kyaukpyu a coastal town along the Bay of Bengal in Myanmar is valuable to China for strategic and economic reasons. This town is the terminal point of China’s $1.5 billion oil pipeline and a parallel natural gas pipeline running till the China’s Yunnan province.
 
 China National Petroleum Corporation and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, state owned firms constructed these pipelines between 2010 and 2015. The gas pipeline entered operation in 2013 capable of sending 12 billion cubic meters of gas to China annually, and the oil pipeline finally entered operation in 2017 capable of carrying roughly 22 million barrels of oil annually. Thus providing China with an alternative route for energy imports from the Middle East, thereby avoiding the chokepoint of Malacca Strait pipeline.
 
 Furthermore, in 2018 China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) leading a consortium of six companies struck a framework agreement with Myanmar on building the Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ). In the same year, Myanmar signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China to establish the China Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC). This 1,700 km long corridor connects China’s Yunnan province to Myanmar’s major economic centers from Mandalay in central Myanmar, to Yangon in south and the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in west. Hence, the Kyaukpyu deep water port is connected to China’s larger Belt and Road Initiative in Myanmar. Yet again arousing fears of Chinese unobstructed economic leverage over Myanmar. The Myanmar government’s 30 percent stake in the project is around $2.2 billion, if it occupies 50 percent stake then it would amount to almost 5% of Myanmar’s GDP, thereby forcing it to rely on Chinese loans. Another crucial concern to the activists was the human rights violations caused during project implementation such as forced relocation of more than 20,000 Rakhine residents and dictated militarisation.

 The governments of small countries like Myanmar are thirsty for investments despite instances of dispossession, exploitation of natural resources and environmental damage by Beijing’s BRI project. A study ‘Greening the Belt and Road Initiative’ by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) revealed that the BRI corridor will affect around 265 threatened species, 1,739 important bird areas and 46 biodiversity hotspots. Hydropower projects backed by China along the Mekong river running through Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam is said to highly disrupt the river flow and create a loss of about one million tons of fish every year. Deforestation in areas such as the Pan Borneo Highway that traverses Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei will make it susceptible to landslides, floods, and other disaster related concerns.
 
 China’s BRI, one of the largest infrastructure undertakings will bring unprecedented economic and environmental shifts. The impact of the project on environment has received negligible attention. The environmental concerns are legitimate and there is very less precedence for analysing and planning the environmental impacts of massive projects at the scale of BRI. Hence, the governments despite their quest for investment must take decisions keeping social and environmental impacts in mind before it gets too late to act.

 BEIJING: China's plan for a modern Silk Road of railways, ports and other facilities linking Asia with Europe hit a $14 billion pothole in Pakistan.
 
 Pakistan's relations with Beijing are so close that officials call China their “Iron Brother”. Despite that, plans for the Diamer-Bhasha Dam were thrown into turmoil in November when the chairman of Pakistan's water authority said Beijing wanted an ownership stake in the hydropower project. He rejected that as against Pakistani interests.
 
 China issued a denial but the official withdrew the dam from among dozens of projects being jointly developed by the two countries.
 
 From Pakistan to Tanzania to Hungary, projects under President Xi Jinping's signature “Belt and Road Initiative” are being cancelled, renegotiated or delayed due to disputes about costs or complaints host countries get too little out of projects built by Chinese companies and financed by loans from Beijing that must be repaid.

 In some areas, Beijing is suffering a political backlash due to fears of domination by Asia's biggest economy.
 
 “Pakistan is one of the countries that is in China's hip pocket, and for Pakistan to stand up and say, `I'm not going to do this with you,' shows it's not as `win-win' as China says it is,” said Robert Koepp, an analyst in Hong Kong for the Economist Corporate Network, a research firm.
 
 “Belt and Road”, announced by Xi in 2013, is a loosely defined umbrella for Chinese-built or -financed projects across 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe.
 
 Other governments welcomed the initiative in a region the Asian Development Bank says needs more than $26 trillion of infrastructure investment by 2030 to keep economies growing. Nations including Japan have given or lent billions of dollars for development, but China's venture is bigger and the only source of money for many projects.
 
 Governments from Washington to Moscow to New Delhi are uneasy Beijing is trying to use its “Belt and Road” to develop a China-centred political structure that will erode their influence.
 
 Among projects that have been derailed or disrupted, authorities in Nepal cancelled plans in November for Chinese companies to build a $2.5 billion dam after they concluded contracts for the Budhi Gandaki Hydro Electric Project violated rules requiring multiple bidders.
 
 Consulting firm BMI Research has compiled a database of $1.8 trillion of infrastructure investments announced across Asia, Africa and the Middle East that include Chinese money or other involvement.
 
 “It's probably too early to say at this point how much of the overall initiative will actually be implemented,” said Christian Zhang, a BMI analyst.
 
 The US and Japanese governments express interest in building contracts or other potential opportunities. But they also are trying to develop alternative initiatives.
 
 The stumbles for one of the world's most ambitious infrastructure ventures could help temper concerns Beijing will increase its strategic influence.

 Even Pakistan, one of China's friendliest neighbours, has failed to agree on key projects.
 
 The two governments are developing facilities with a total cost of $60 billion including power plants and railways to link China's far west with the Chinese-built port of Gwadar on the Indian Ocean.
 
 A visit by a Chinese assistant foreign minister in November produced no agreement on railway projects in the southern city of Karachi valued at $10 billion and a $260 million airport for Gwadar.
 
 The same month, the chairman of the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority announced the Diamer-Bhasha Dam would be withdrawn from joint development.
 
 “Chinese conditions for financing the Diamer-Bhasha Dam were not doable and against our interests,” the official, Muzammil Hussain, told legislators, according to Pakistani news reports.
 
 The Chinese Cabinet agency overseeing “Belt and Road”, the National Development and Reform Commission, denied in a written statement that it asked for an ownership stake.
 
 “Belt and Road” is interwoven with official efforts to export Chinese rail, hydropower and other technology and steel, aluminum and other industrial goods.
 
 In Thailand, work on a $15 billion high-speed railway was suspended in 2016 following complaints too little business went to Thai companies. A new plan announced in July gives local contractors a bigger role.

491,Bangkok Post,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1512470/green-light-for-kyaukphyu,-1,,Thailand,E,2018-07-30 00:00:00,Green light for Kyaukphyu,"Fresh negotiations are under way to resolve the impasse that has prevented progress on the Chinese-backed Kyaukphyu megaproject for more than three years, according to Myanmar's deputy finance minister.
 
 ""Progress so far has been promising, and there is general agreement that the project should be scaled down,"" Winston Set Aung told Asia Focus.
 
 ""It will be a demand-based rather than a supply-based project, and any expansion will only be considered if there is sufficient demand for it.""
 
 The administration of former president Thein Sein agreed in 2015 to allow a consortium led by the Chinese investment company CITIC Group to develop the project in Rakhine state. However, the civilian government that took office the following year has expressed concerns about the project becoming a white elephant and leaving the Myanmar government heavily in debt.
 
 ""The terms of the proposed contract are unfair to Myanmar, we cannot accept them,"" Commerce Minister Than Myint, then in charge of the Kyaukphyu negotiations, told Asia Focus last November, on the eve of a trip to Beijing to discuss a host of bilateral matters with China, including Kyaukphyu.
 
 The government's chief economic adviser, Sean Turnell, has also warned about some of the ""crazy"" and ""absurd"" features of the deal as it currently stands.
 
 The project -- as originally negotiated -- is heavily overcapitalised, he told Asia Focus some months ago. He sees the danger of a repeat of the fate of Chinese port megaprojects at Gwadar in Pakistan and Hambantota in Sri Lanka.
 
 Colombo borrowed heavily to construct the latter, but could not repay the loans and had to give China a 99-year lease on Hambantota in return for debt relief. Mr Turnell even visited Sri Lanka earlier this year to see the problems for himself.
 
 Winston Set Aung, who has since been given the main responsibility for overseeing Kyaukphyu, has offered assurances that Myanmar will not accept any high risks.
 
 ""We have already agreed that the Myanmar government will not fall into a debt trap over the Kyaukphyu port or the SEZ (Special Economic Zone),"" he said.
 
 Details of the ongoing discussions are confidential, but senior government sources involved in talks say the port project has been scaled down from the original plan. Current projections call for an investment of just under US$1 billion, compared with around over $7 billion before, and a further $2 billion for the SEZ.

 ""It was way bigger than it should be or needs to be,"" said Mr Turnell. Not more than 10% of trade with China will go through Kyaukphyu, he estimated. But even if all trade with China went through Kyaukphyu, the port would utilise less 30% of its originally planned capacity in the next five years.
 
 The proposed contractual arrangement between Myanmar and the Chinese consortium was also a sore point. The Thein Sein government, bowing to Chinese pressure, agreed on a 15% share for Myanmar and 85% for the CITIC-led group.
 
 When the new government led by the National League for Democracy took over the negotiations, it insisted on a 30% share. The Chinese consortium reluctantly agreed, but insisted that Myanmar had to provide a financial contribution for the extra share.
 
 ""The Myanmar consortium just wants more shares but they don't want to take more financing responsibility,"" Yuan Shaobin, executive president of CITIC Myanmar, said in October last year. ""The shift from 15% means that they should take on some of the financing responsibilities from CITIC.
 
 ""Myanmar should take the same risk as us. We should have Myanmar partners who would be willing to take on the same risk with us. It's business.""
 
 But according to senior government sources involved in the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, CITIC has finally backtracked and agreed to a 30% share for Myanmar at no extra cost to the government. Also, it is no longer demanding that Myanmar borrow as much as $2 billion from Chinese state banks.
 
 As well, there will be no Myanmar government sovereign backing for any of the project's debts. But the government will pay its proportionate share of any future costs.
 
 The development of Kyaukphyu has been divided into segments, with the port the first project. Future expansion will only be initiated once the previous stage has been started and is profitable -- earning income above the project's variable costs, according to the government source. ""Expansion will only be agreed if there is realistic demand for it, and it is in Myanmar's interests,"" he said.
 
 Negotiations on the final contract with the CITIC consortium -- which includes China Harbor Engineering, China Merchants, TEDA Investment, Yunnan Construction Engineering Group and Thailand's Charoen Pokphand Group -- are continuing, according to government sources. Issues related to dispute settlement mechanisms and arbitration are being reviewed, and provisions for economic and social impact studies are also on the agenda.
 
 The hope is to complete the deal in the next two to three months, according to Thant Myint, in time for it to be signed during the scheduled state visit of Chinese President Xi JInping.
 
 The Kyaukphyu port in particular, as well as the SEZ, are of enormous strategic interest to China. A deep-sea port on the Bay of Bengal would help China enormously to develop maritime access to the Indian Ocean and diversify its sea trade routes.
 
 The Kyaukphyu port would also give China an alternative route for its energy imports from the Middle East that crucially avoids the Malacca Straits and would save some 5,000 kilometres sailing distance for shipments to China from India and beyond.
 
 The drive to diversify its shipping routes -- and to increase economic clout in neighbouring countries -- is a major impetus behind new Belt and Road initiative, which envisions infrastructure and trade networks linking China with every part of the Eurasian continent.
 
 Though the project fits neatly into the Belt and Road framework, China's cooperation in the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone was in the works years before the strategy was announced. In 2009, Myanmar signed a memorandum of understanding with China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) to build an oil pipeline linking Maday Island in Kyaukphyu with southern Yunnan province in China. That pipeline, which allows crude from the Middle East to be offloaded in Kyaukphyu and shipped overland to China, was completed in January 2015.
 
 Around the same time, CITIC signed a memorandum of understanding with Myanmar to construct a deep-sea port and railway network in the Kyaukphyu SEZ. Unlike the oil pipeline, the rail and port projects stalled -- and the railway agreement expired in 2014 without construction ever beginning.
 
 However, with the CITIC consortium now getting a green light, and resumption of the SEZ project also on the horizon, plans for road and rail links between Myanmar and China are being resurrected. Now they are as part of Beijing's revised and grandiose China-Myanmar economic corridor, with agreements also expected to be signed in the near future, possibly also during President Xi's visit.","['port', 'citic', 'chinese', 'myanmar', 'economic', 'consortium', 'agreed', 'green', 'kyaukphyu', 'china', 'light', 'project']","{'China': 17, 'India': 2, 'Sri Lanka': 2, 'Myanmar': 20, 'Pakistan': 1, 'Thailand': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 In early February, the Chinese embassy in Yangon confirmed that Beijing will set up a Belt and Road dispute settlement mechanism involving new courts, while news media reported that three international commercial courts will be set up by China’s Supreme People’s Court in Xi’an, Shenzhen and Beijing.
 
 In Myanmar, the proposed Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Rakhine State is among the foremost mega projects in the Belt and Road Initiative. The proposed SEZ has huge implications on Rakhine’s development, Myanmar’s trade economy, foreign investments, infrastructure as well as human rights. U Kyaw Htin from CITIC Myanmar told The Myanmar Times on February 2 that they were only made aware of the development through news reports about the BRI courts, adding that since the parties involved are still in negotiations, the dispute settlement mechanism is not finalised.
 
 Beijing’s decision to create a new mechanism came under fire earlier, with an academic lambasting such arrangements as “essentially tools for corporations to restrict access to justice”. But there are lawyers in Myanmar who defended and supported the proposal.
 
 ...this initiative could be perceived in such way as suggesting that the vehicle might be controlled by Chinese courts and ultimately the Chinese government, depending on its structure. - Filip Lauwerysen, EuroCham
 
 
 
 
 
 More choices to settle dispute
 
 Bodenheimer Herzberg, an international arbitration specialist in Europe, confirmed that when it comes to viability of the alleged plans, several well-established arbitration centres exist in the region, the ones in Singapore and Hong Kong being the most prominent. There are also alternatives such as Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre for Arbitration (KLRCA) in Malaysia or even existing institutions in mainland China, such as the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC). The arbitration awards issued under the rules of the established arbitration institutions do bring about the advantage of being enforceable in most countries under the ""New York Convention"".
 
 Filip Lauwerysen, chief executive of European Chamber of Commerce in Myanmar (EuroCham), outlined several prerequisites for the planned courts to be viable in the existing environment.
 
 “Foremost, the initiative should not be seen as an envisaged replacement of arbitration as a means of settling disputes but rather serves as a companion rather than a competitor to arbitration as it might be one more option among a suite of viable alternatives to resolve transnational commercial disputes,” he stated.
 
 The established arbitration institutions in Singapore and Hong Kong are embedded in a culture dominated by common law influence. This ignores that many countries in the region are based on civil law systems, including China. Setting up a court system might enable future parties to conduct proceedings also in Chinese without significantly higher costs if the infrastructure is provided.
 
 Furthermore, the establishment of an international court allows for new approaches both with regard to implication of costs and the introduction of other means of dispute resolution such as mediation. Especially with respect to the likely disputes in connection with the BRI, the advantage of a developed jurisprudence, rather than confidential arbitration, and the facilitated ability to join third parties to disputes might make this project very viable. With regard to enforcement, decisions by the courts might be appealing for non-Chinese parties when it comes to enforcement in China.
 
 Similarly, Dr William Wong, a Hong Kong senior counsel who advocated the city’s legal sector to capitalise on BRI opportunities, told The Myanmar Times that the proposal is meant to provide another choice for parties to resolve international commercial disputes.
 
 “Rather, like the Singaporean International Commercial Courts and the Singaporean Arbitration Centre, parties can opt in a court system or an arbitration route. It is meant to provide a wider range of choices for the parties. The establishment of a wide range of reputable disputes resolution infrastructures is to be welcomed,” the barrister noted.
 
 The proposal is only at an early stage, full details have to be worked out later. - Dr William Wong SC, Barrister
 
 All depends on the details
 
 However, the EuroCham chief said that the question regarding to what extent such a court would be perceived as a neutral dispute settlement venue will depend largely on its set-up and the composition of judges, regional or international.
 
 “When looking at the foreseen structure, with Shenzhen covering the Maritime Silk Road, the court might also establish specialised competence in the field of maritime disputes.
 
 “In the Myanmar context, the general tensions and disputes between the local population on Chinese infrastructure projects are also to be considered. Having a court in China ruling over such disputes could be counterproductive.
 
 “I believe that this initiative could be perceived in such way as suggesting that the vehicle might be controlled by Chinese courts and ultimately the Chinese government, depending on its structure. Secondly, a more international setup could have been seen by establishing an ASEAN-Chinese arbitration panel or choosing a neutral third country arbitration centre or third country commercial court,” Mr Lauwerysen observed.
 
 Likewise, James Bridgeman SC, president of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, stated that an international judiciary could help secure impartiality and independence of the courts.
 
 “Parties to investment treaties and trade agreements require an effective dispute resolution mechanism that is independent, impartial, applies the rule of law and delivers enforceable determinations. How this is to be achieved is a matter for the parties themselves.
 
 “It could be achieved by establishing a permanent court sitting in one or more jurisdictions with an international judiciary. There was strong support for this approach in the EU in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership [TTIP] negotiations with the USA,” he explained.
 
 In the Myanmar context, the general tensions and disputes between the local population on Chinese infrastructure projects are also to be considered. Having a court in China ruling over such disputes could be counterproductive. - Filip Lauwerysen, EuroCham
 
 Regulatory powers at risk
 
 Daniel Aguirre, Greenwich University’s senior lecturer in law and former legal adviser of the International Commission of Jurists in Yangon, noted that the development is not surprising given how lucrative the investment arbitration market has become. Linking development projects along the BRI to a Chinese arbitration court would help China to establish a foothold in international arbitration market. But this would take a long time to set up and negotiate existing investment agreements between China and the countries involved.
 
 He highlighted that any new investment arbitration centre must be governed by rules that protect the ability of host countries to pass regulation protecting national development policies, human rights and the environment even if these conflict with the interests of Chinese investors.
 
 “States should not be pressured to sign away their legitimate regulatory powers in exchange for Chinese investment,” Dr Aguirre argued.
 
 Unfortunately, those eager to scrutinise the details and pass judgement will be disappointed. According to Dr Wong, the proposal is only at an early stage and more details have to be worked out later.","['arbitration', 'courts', 'chinese', 'belt', 'court', 'disputes', 'china', 'parties', 'myanmar', 'international', 'road', 'devil', 'investment']","{'China': 9, 'Hong Kong': 3, 'Myanmar': 9, 'Malaysia': 1, 'Singapore': 4, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

Contract disputes are inevitably a risk in large-scale infrastructure projects between jurisdictions which are at different stages of development and legal maturity.
 
 
 
 
 
 Dr Colin Ong, president of Arbitration Association Brunei Darussalam (AABD), made the comments during a panel session about infrastructure dispute resolution in a Belt and Road Summit.
 
 Belt and Road Summit 2017 was jointly organised by the Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), on September 11. A lot of focus was on ASEAN. In one of the sessions, a panel of arbitrators and legal professionals discussed the future of cross-border infrastructure investments related to the BRI.
 
 In Thilawa Special Economic Zone (which is not a BRI project), for example, some investors have used Singapore as the dispute resolution platform, because of the lack of confidence in the legal system in Myanmar. With an upsurge in investments and development of large-scale infrastructure brought about by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the HKTDC expected that infrastructure disputes will increase significantly in the coming years. When the legal system in the host country is not sufficiently advanced to cope with all the aspects of the projects and contracts, especially projects involving cross-border collaboration, there are risks.

 Contract disputes are an inevitable risk in large infrastructure projects between countries which have significantly different development levels and legal systems. Litigation is expensive and “may very well destroy relationships between the two parties involved”, the panel noted. Mediation and arbitration offer a more cost-effective way of managing dispute resolution.
 
 Rimsky Yuen, Secretary for Justice at the Hong Kong government, repeated the Asian Development Bank’s report that developing Asia will need to invest US$1.7 trillion per year in infrastructure to maintain growth, reduce poverty and cope with climate change. This includes investment in power, transport, water, sanitation and telecommunications infrastructure.
 
 The official emphasised that there is a pressing need to propose legal risk management with legal due diligence and contract drafting with risk-avoidance provisions and arbitration clauses. The BRI countries comprise over 60 jurisdictions with diverse legal systems, so there is a need for legal risk management. “Robust dispute-resolution mechanisms and professional legal advice are essential,” according to Mr Yuen.
 
 Joint Sino-ASEAN panel
 
 Dr Colin Ong, AABD president, focused on some of the complex legal issues involving cross-border transactions. He emphasised that, for any BRI-led projects, a legal framework and dispute-resolution system must be in place from the start. He pointed out that there are no international standards for resolving legal disputes and that Belt and Road countries are at different stages of development and legal maturity.
 
 With contracts often involving three or more countries, the question becomes whose laws are applied, Dr Ong said. He argued that it is highly unlikely that a mature and reliable forum will be established to deal with complex disputes involving all Belt and Road countries, but that it was possible for a smaller bloc of countries to do this.
 
 “ASEAN, for example, is getting serious about harmonising laws and legal systems within the bloc,” he added. He suggested that this could be extended to include Hong Kong and, in theory, China.
 
 He argued against waiting for ASEAN to harmonise all of its laws because that would take too long, so it would be better to focus on establishing a common dispute-resolution mechanism.
 
 Dr Ong explained that the present dispute-resolution system focuses on government-to-government (G2G) contracts, but that this system needs to be extended to private enterprises. He proposed setting up a panel of arbitrators – 60 from ASEAN countries (six from each country) and 40 from China.
 
 Dispute resolution
 
 Justin D’Agostino, head of disputes and managing partner in Asia for Herbert Smith Freehills, shared his firm’s findings of a decade of client research that his firm conducted to determine what their clients want in terms of dispute resolution. The findings showed overwhelmingly that they want more assistance with dispute avoidance, management and resolution, and that corporations with these systems in place can avoid disputes to begin with.
 
 His findings revealed that early case assessment (ECA) was common in the US and the UK, but not in Asia. Clients wanted more ECA to avoid escalation of disputes. With ECA, at the beginning of a dispute, a company estimates the money, time and human capital required to fight a case. It also engages an in-house legal team to assess the facts, legal issues and commercial interests at stake.
 
 ASEAN, for example, is getting serious about harmonising laws and legal systems within the bloc.

 Additionally, companies his firm conducted research on want more structured project management running disputes, not just lawyers, and they want more opportunities for meditation. The research indicates that mediation works, but that it is not yet as common in Asia as it is in the West.
 
 Mr D’Agostino presented a toolkit for managing bigger, highly complex BRI-related contracts and disputes which may arise. This involves mapping out all the tasks and activities involved in a dispute to determine the people, time and money required to manage the case. He pointed out that information technology was what he called “the big disruptor” because, very recently, new tools have become available in terms of digital platforms, which allow clients to see the work process much more clearly. Hence, they can buy into the dispute-management process more easily.
 
 The Herbert Smith Freehills partner argued that dispute resolution must be improved because when you get it right you resolve the dispute in a much more cost-effective manner for your clients than through litigation.
 
 The only drawback to arbitration is that there is very limited appeal against arbitral awards, according to Mr D’Agostino. But he believed that “the benefits far outweigh this [drawback]”, as arbitration allows more flexibility, ease of cross-border enforcement of arbitral awards, and more privacy as well as confidentiality.
 
 Contract details
 
 Paul Starr, partner and practice leader of Dispute Resolution and Infrastructure at King & Wood Mallesons in Hong Kong, brought up a case study to highlight the problems companies encounter because they pay insufficient attention to contract details. The firms fail to look closely at the “what-if” clauses – clauses which determine what happen if things go wrong. In this case a clause had been cut and pasted from one contract to another, but the information was not corrected. Thus, a badly drafted contract was secured, which resulted in the company potentially losing hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
 Mr Starr then suggested that Asian countries can be considered as a neutral platform for dispute resolution for Belt and Road countries. He observed that Hong Kong Kong as a neutral, independent centre for mediation and arbitration has its obvious legal and geographical strengths, as well as the quality of life that makes it a desirable destination for both work and pleasure.","['countries', 'proposed', 'arbitration', 'resolution', 'tackle', 'belt', 'system', 'dispute', 'infrastructure', 'disputes', 'legal', 'kong', 'sinoasean', 'panel', 'road']","{'Brunei Darussalam': 2, 'China': 2, 'Hong Kong': 6, 'Myanmar': 1, 'Singapore': 1, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

 Some urged Myanmar to be more proactive in navigating its involvement in the scheme. Many emphasised the importance of transparency, public engagement and adhering to international practices. But some have also expressed reservation and scepticism against China’s ambitious scheme.
 
 Last month, the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation attracted the largest number of foreign dignitaries to the Chinese capital since the 2008 Olympic Games. Launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 as “One Belt, One Road”, the scheme involves China underwriting billion-dollar investments, mainly in infrastructure, in countries along the old Silk Road and new routes, creating an extensive trade network by linking Asia, Europe and Africa. The financial commitment illustrates the ambition: China is spending roughly US$150 billion a year in the 68 countries which have signed on to the project. The China Development Bank alone has earmarked $890 billion for some 900 projects.
 
 The Myanmar Times interviewed Jonathan Woetzel, McKinsey senior partner and McKinsey Global Institute director, as well as Bernard Chan, president of Asia Financial Holdings and grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, on how the BRI will play out in Myanmar and the region.
 
 
 
 
 
 Political analysts and commentators have argued that China is ready to ensure a politically stable environment for its southwestern region, which is a core part of the BRI. This explains China’s political involvement in Myanmar’s peace process.
 
 Now that the political aspect is unfolding gradually, The Myanmar Times asked businesses from various countries and sectors for their views of the BRI.
 
 Good news for infrastructure but Myanmar should be more proactive
 
 Nick Powell, managing partner of Delta Capital Myanmar and director of Simon Murray & Company (SMC), a pan-Asian investment company, highlighted that projects should be commercially viable and look into precedence in other parts of Asia where those infrastructure projects succeeded.
 
 “China’s BRI is a good opportunity for Myanmar and its infrastructure challenges. China is a leader in financing and building infrastructure across the spectrum. What the government needs to be cautious of are possible political motives and potential leverage this could give China Inc.
 
 “The best way to mitigate this is to make sure these projects stand on purely commercial basis, and that the operators and financiers will be paid back over the agreed term and the assets transferred to Myanmar. There are plenty examples of where it has worked, such as in Asia, and where it has not, such as in Africa,” he said.
 
 Infrastructure is a recurring theme highlighted by many businesspersons, including Khin Maung Win, CEO of Myanmar Shwe Pyi Tractors, who said that Myanmar should be proactive in defining its role in the scheme. He also stressed that public engagement for the projects and transparency were crucial
 
 “The BRI is complementary to Myanmar’s strategic national interests specifically in trade, energy needs and closing infrastructure gap. Myanmar stands to gain greatly from this initiative and should take the lead in defining its role and purpose in the BRI.
 
 “Early public engagement is critical as from past experience, commercial gains from such cooperation, albeit smaller scale, were rarely transparent,” he said.
 
 Tomoaki Yabe, managing director of Daizen Myanmar, said that the BRI represented a boost in investments for the country’s infrastructure development. More notably, he also highlighted how, by building on the experience of Thilawa SEZ, BRI-related investments and projects can genuinely benefit the country and its private sector.
 
 “Better infrastructure is vital for a robust logistics sector. Myanmar needs more investments to get the hardware ready. We have worked with Chinese companies and more collaboration, encouraged by the BRI, is definitely good news.
 
 “Only with the technologies, sufficient investment and a sound framework which aligns with the international standard can Myanmar realise its geographical potential as the regional hub.
 
 “Thilawa Special Economic Zone is a strong example illustrating how foreign direct investments, foreign technologies and local manpower can create employment opportunities and deliver significant economic growth. If Kyaukpyu and other BRI-led projects can build on the lessons of Thilawa SEZ and offer opportunities inclusive of local and international businesses, Myanmar will certainly benefit from the scheme,” he said.
 
 Similarly, William Greenlee, managing director of DFDL’s Myanmar office and also American Chamber of Commerce Myanmar’s legal committee chair, told The Myanmar Times that the financing resulting from the scheme, as long as it was commercially sound and responsible, should be embraced with open arms.
 
 “The BRI is a great opportunity for Myanmar. At this nascent stage of infrastructure development, I would think all financing assistance would be welcome. Organisations like Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank [AIIB] and China Development Bank will be able to provide inexpensive financing to large and expensive projects. This is a huge benefit as, of course, financing such projects is the first big hurdle.
 
 “And like such financing from other countries, as long as the relevant projects are commercially viable and environmentally and socially responsible, financing from China under this initiative should be welcomed with open arms,” he said.
 
 Others echoed the need for Myanmar to take an active part of the collaboration, instead of being reactionary. Ken Tun, chief executive officer of Parami Energy, said the country should realise its strategic importance in both land and maritime aspect of the BRI and be quick to act.
 
 “Myanmar signed five agreements during the Beijing summit including the Belt and Road framework on cooperation and the issue of border trade. Myanmar plays a strategic role in both the land and maritime part of the BRI.
 
 “It is important that Myanmar should push for proactive policies for BRI collaboration, particularly when other countries have already geared up to benefit from being part of the BRI,” he said.
 
 Aye Thiha, the head of Thiha Group who is also chair of government affairs committee at the American Chamber, said the BRI would unlock Myanmar’s geographical advantage.
 
 “I would very much welcome the BRI as it would unlock the full potential of Myanmar’s ideal geographic location between the economic powerhouses, China and India.
 
 “Once clearly defined with a specific timeline, the Initiative will also fill up the much needed infrastructure gap and provide Myanmar better connectivity with the rest of the world.
 
 “In my humble opinion, the risks of such an initiative are overshadowed by the economic benefits,” he said.
 
 Foreign chambers weigh in
 
 When asked about whether the BRI is a valuable opportunity for Myanmar to fill the infrastructure gap, Paul Wilson, president of American Chamber of Commerce Myanmar and managing director of US-owned investment company Four Rivers, said, “As a country with significant development needs, we think it reasonable for Myanmar to explore multiple options of investment and partnerships.”
 
 In terms of the reaction of American businesses in the country, Mr Wilson was keen to raise the issue of business ethics and labour standards.
 
 “The US business community in Myanmar is committed to supporting inclusive economic growth and responsible investment. US companies are proud to bring the highest standards of business ethics and labour standards to emerging markets.
 
 “Our expectation is that these high standards raise the bar for other international businesses and investors, which we believe is positive for the Myanmar government and people,” he said.
 
 Katsuji Nakagawa, chair of Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Myanmar and country head of Sumitomo Corporation Group in Myanmar, conceded that Myanmar had to depend on China for both the economy and national peace. Japanese businesses will be observing how the dynamics change and will also take into account other factors, such as US policy toward China.
 
 “China has now expressed their policy to positively get involved in the peace process between Myanmar’s national armed forces and ethnic armed groups. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi seems to have no other choices but to depend on China to stabilise the long-continued conflict in northern Myanmar.
 
 “Under the BRI, Myanmar will rely on China not only for their economic growth by China’s development assistance, but also for solving their internal affairs. Japanese businesses will continue to carefully observe how China and Myanmar relationship would be strengthened.
 
 “In addition, we, Japan, think it is necessary to closely watch the future direction and movement of the BRI, including the ramification caused by the possible shift of the US policy toward China and we will need to plot our business strategy properly,” he said.
 
 In contrast, Peter Beynon, chair of British Chamber of Commerce Myanmar, sounded more upbeat and less circumspect, highlighting the necessity for Myanmar to carve out its part in the BRI.
 
 ""My thoughts are generally positive as long as Myanmar is able to retain value within its economy.
 
 ""In the short term, this will mean its ability to negotiate a significant portion of an involvement in the construction of the BRI.
 
 ""In the medium to long term, there will be increased trade volumes, investment and business potential for the country. This should be significant.
 
 ""There is a concern at the impact on communities who will be moved and livelihoods altered, but this is inevitable and people resist change. I am positive,"" he said.

 This year marks the 70th anniversary since the People’s Republic of China and Myanmar established formal diplomatic recognition. Xi’s visit is seen as an attempt to further cement bilateral relations and pushing ahead the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor scheme as well as other projects under the Belt and Road Initiative.
 
 One of the most watched developments is the highly-anticipated inking of Kyaukphyu port, a China-backed scheme under Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). A consortium led by CITIC, comprised of four other Chinese firms and Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group, aims to develop the deep-sea port as part of a special economic zone (SEZ) in the restive state.
 
 “There are seven agreements under the framework agreement for Kyaukphyu. Two will be signed,” deputy commerce minister U Aung Htoo told the reporters in Nay Pyi Taw on Thursday, referring to the “framework agreement” signed by the two sides in late 2018.
 
 Other Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) are also expected to be signed during the Chinese leader’s visit, including the export of crops and cattle, according to the minister, who made no mention of the now-suspended Myitsone dam.
 
 
 
 
 
 The controversial hydrodam, a project whose fate remains undecided under almost four years of the Daw Suu administration, is not expected to be one of the deals sealed, according to Ma Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee, deputy director at the Institute of Strategy and Policy Myanmar.
 
 Kyaukphyu port’s 2018 framework agreement paves way for an actual concession-granting deal, said executive president of CITIC Myanmar Yuan Shaobin in 2017. The industrial park involves three agreements: an investment, shareholder and lease agreement, while the port requires a concession agreement on top of those three agreements.
 
 The megaproject was awarded to the consortium during the last months of U Thein Sein’s presidency. Negotiations stalled in the first two years under the National League for Democracy-led government, which then renegotiated the port’s price tag from US$7.5 billion to $1.3 billion.
 
 The project proponents are expected to initiate the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) and preliminary geological survey soon, hiring Canadian firm Hatch as project manager.
 
 Xi will meet with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as well as Commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing during his trip, China’s vice foreign minister Luo Zhaohui said at a press conference on Friday.
 
 “As this trip is to foster positive relations and this is the year [marking the] 70th anniversary of China-Myanmar diplomatic relations, I don't think China would do such an inconsiderate move,” said Ma Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee of the Institute of Strategy and Policy Myanmar, referring to the resumption of Myitsone dam.
 
 “Given the advancement in CMEC - which runs through several conflict-sensitive areas - China is likely to be more deeply involved with the Myanmar peace process,” the analyst added.
 
 Ma Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee argued that conflicts have to be managed before key business deals along the CMEC could take off. Beijing-backed plans for road and rail construction linking Muse and Mandalay were undermined when parts of northern Shan State had bridges blown up and roads ambushed in mid-2019 because of fighting between the Tatmadaw and the Brotherhood Alliance, a coalition of ethnic armed groups.
 
 Bilateral relations have warmed since the days when U Thein Sein halted Myitsone dam, as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi faces a barricade of criticisms from the international community, including those in Europe and America, for her handling of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in northern Rakhine.
 
 China is by far the biggest source of cumulative FDI commitments in Myanmar, while Beijing is seen by Nay Pyi Taw as a key stakeholder in the peace process.
 
 Looking ahead, Ma Khin Khin Kyaw Kyee said Myanmar would move even closer to China’s orbit as the international backlash against the State Counsellor’s defence against accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice last month. Western Union this week became the latest foreign firm to cut ties with Myanmar military companies.","['kyaw', 'visit', 'state', 'aung', 'port', 'khin', 'chinabacked', 'agreement', 'xis', 'kyee', 'myanmar', 'ahead', 'relations', 'suu']","{'China': 10, 'Myanmar': 11, 'Thailand': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

There are various activities ahead,” he remarked. U Set Aung, as chair of Kyaukphyu SEZ Management Committee (KSMC), said the project will not amount to debt burden for Myanmar. “Many negotiations were made to make the project sustainable and to avoid a burden for Myanmar both at present and in the future,” he explained, pledging transparency in the process.
 
 
 
 
 
 The CITIC chair emphasised that it is a Belt and Road Initiative project and will connect Myanmar with the regional networks. The port will be connected to Western China and through China and the Pacific, as well as to the “East-West Economic Corridor”, joining other ASEAN economies.
 
 Deputy commerce minister U Aung Htoo said an Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) will commence in a year and the two parties will work to move forward the project based on the framework agreement, which covers the construction of two deep-water berths. New industrial zones will be negotiated and “about three framework agreements will be made.”
 
 The proposed Kyaukphyu SEZ, located in central Rakhine State, originally consisted of an industrial park and a deep-sea port. In 2015, a CITIC-led consortium won the bid to develop both components. The National League for Democracy-led government pushed the stake ratio to 70:30 from 85:15. The US$7.5 billion estimated price tag of the port was subsequently reduced to $1.3 billion, regarding the first phase of the project.
 
 Myanmar is expected to give half of its 30pc to private companies. Currently, 50 local firms expressed an interest to invest in the project. Chang Zhenming added that, in a decade, 90pc of the managerial positions will be filled with Myanmar workers. A total of 100,000 locals are expected to be hired. The project proponents sad the port will bring a total of US$6.5 billion in tax revenue and the industrial zone will bring $7.8 billion over a 50-year period. When the industrial zone is operating at full capacity, an annual $3.2 billion earning is expected.
 
 
 
 
 
 However, officials in the press conference did not talk about implementing a recommendation from Kofi Annan’s Rakhine Commission: to undertake a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). It is the Myanmar government, not the developers, who decides whether to undertake an SEA. While that is not legally required, unlike EIA Procedures, there is pressure to follow through with the SEA because State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi had publicly endorsed all the recommendations and pledged to implement them. In fact, the ESIA/ EIA should be done after the conclusion of the SEA and should be informed by the findings of the SEA.
 
 A labour market assessment is also among the recommendations of the Rakhine Commission. The Myanmar Times understands that the authorities are doing so in collaboration with International Labour Organisation (ILO).
 
 Notably, yesterday’s agreement is just the start of a series of complex negotiations yet to come. Last year, Yuan Shaobin, executive president of CITIC Myanmar, said the framework agreement merely serves as a small step forward for both sides to sign all the transaction documents necessary for the SEZ proposal to commence. The industrial park involves three agreements: an investment, shareholder and lease agreement, while the port requires the same agreements together with a concession agreement.
 
 With the framework agreement secured, there will still be a lot of negotiations in the coming months to hammer out the real deals. Nothing is finalised until those agreements are inked.
 
 A lot is at stake in this project due to its location, size and scale. The Myanmar government has been weak in enforcing contracts and managing the risks and potential conflicts associated with large-scale infrastructure projects. For example, if members of the community are protesting against compulsory land acquisition and authorities in response disperse the protestors by force, local people are likely to put the blame on the developer, which in turn will fuel the tension between the companies and the residents. A grievance mechanism ought to be in place from the very start of the process. Grievance mechanism requirements are now standard in Environmental Compliance Certificates (ECC), which are legally required before any construction work or land acquisition activities are allowed to take place.
 
 Transparency is vital to reduce and mitigate the human rights risks and conflict dimension on this SEZ project, including forced eviction, grievance mechanism and threats to livelihoods. What’s important is to be transparent, so that those whose thought they were losing their land to compulsory acquisition know whether they will or not. Those who were worried that their livelihoods might be affected would also know how that would work out.
 
 
 
 With the SEZ, the complicating factor is always ""who is responsible for what"". Does the buck stop at the regional authority, the central government, the KSMC or the developer? The local community and the wider public deserve to know what is going on with a project as significant as this. Thilawa SEZ serves as a good lesson why transparency is needed much earlier in the process.
 
 The port is expected to be another key development in Sino-Myanmar cooperation. In September, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor. Meanwhile, the twin Chinese oil and gas pipelines run from Kyaukphyu to Kunming, capital of China's Yunnan Province, since last year.","['industrial', 'port', 'sea', 'agreement', 'framework', 'agreements', 'billion', 'kyaukphyu', 'sez', 'happens', 'myanmar', 'project']","{'China': 4, 'Myanmar': 11, 'United States': 2}",,,,,

This mega project was dubbed as the ""mini Singapore"" by the Financial Times. In 2015, a consortium led by CITIC the won bid to develop both the port and the park. The consortium includes China Harbor Engineering, China Merchants, TEDA Investment, Yunnan Construction Engineering Group and Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group. Consulted by Singapore Jurong and PwC, the consortium took part in the bidding and won the tender. Under the shareholder structure permitted by the government under U Thein Sein, China is to have an 85 percent stake in the deep-sea port, with Myanmar holding the remaining 15pc.
 
 
 
 There seems to be a misconception that we, CITIC, are being greedy to ask for 85pc, but it was originally, clearly written. - Warren Hua, CITIC
 
 The Chinese consortium, led by Chinese state-owned CITIC Group, is currently in negotiations with Nay Pyi Taw on the framework agreements of both components of the SEZ – the industrial park and the deep-sea port.
 
 In an exclusive interview on October 12, Yuan Shaobin, executive president of CITIC Myanmar, expressed frustration over the negotiations, telling The Myanmar Times that talks have been ongoing for two years with little progress. “The agreement for the framework is nearly ready, it just needs some progress to be approved,” he said.
 
 
 
 
 
 But Mr Yuan stressed that the framework agreement merely serves as a small step forward and is not the target. The ultimate aim is to sign all the transaction documents which will enable work at the SEZ to commence. The industrial park involves three agreements: a investment agreement, a shareholder agreement, and a land lease agreement, while the port requires the same agreements together with an additional concession agreement.
 
 “We need some more time for more details to be discussed and negotiated. And now this hasn’t yet started. We don’t know when we can start negotiating these kinds of agreement. We have prepared all the drafts of the agreements according to the world’s best practices, but we still need feedback [from Myanmar] to revise and modify the agreement clause by clause. This is the current situation,” he said.
 
 Warren Hua, legal advisor to CITIC Construction added that, on top of those deals, ancillary documents and financing documents will need to be ironed out as well.
 
 Delay after delay
 
 In August, Dr Oo Maung, vice-chair of Kyaukphyu SEZ Management Committee, told The Myanmar Times that the equity shares and details between CITIC consortium and Myanmar Kyaukphyu SEZ Holding Company (MKSHC consortium) was being negotiated and he expected an agreement to be signed within that month.
 
 It is now October and negotiations have come to naught. “The negotiations and all the relevant works are going forward so slowly,” Mr Yuan said.
 
 He added that even if the transaction documents are signed now, the investors cannot commence the project immediately because it would take at least 1.5 years to complete the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process and for the EIA to be approved.
 
 Mr Yuan now estimates that the project could only start after two years following the ratification of transaction agreements. “We are ready to sign. Anytime Myanmar is ready, we are ready,” he said, making clear their frustration over the lack of progress and indicated that the ball is in the government's court to end the inertia and get on with the work.
 
 New demands
 
 So what is causing the delays? The disagreement between the two sides concerns the Myanmar consortium’s new demands to raise its stake to 30pc as well as receive dividends but to not shoulder financing responsibility.
 
 The request for proposal (RFP) for the SEZ was first drafted in 2014, when the former government instructed that “the bidder shall hold a stake of not more than 85pc, while the Myanmar government and government designated entity shall hold a stake of not less than 15pc.”
 
 “The Myanmar consortium just wants more shares but they don’t want to take more financing responsibility,” Mr Yuan noted, adding that negotiations on resolving this issue is taking time.
 
 He stressed that the CITIC consortium has already paid a very attractive price for participation in the Kyaukphyu SEZ. “We gave a very, very high price for the land and concession rights. The Myanmar side just needs to pay the equity – 15pc of the first phase of the deep-sea port – and does not need to consider further financing responsibilities [in the next three phases],” Mr Yuan said. The next three phases will be funded by the revenue generated by the first phase and loans from CITIC with an interest rate of 1.5 percent per annum.
 
 CITIC emphasised that the total investment cost of the port project, covering all four phases, would amount to US$7.2 billion, whereas the Myanmar side will only need to contribute $74 million.
 
 “The Myanmar side would also have 15pc of the dividends,” Mr Hua added.
 
 Mr Yuan said that the Myanmar government thinks the offer from CITIC is good and “they want to get more shares but they don’t want to [make any financing responsibilities]. If they want more shares, CITIC cannot take on all the financing responsibilities. It should be shifted proportionately.”
 
 “We have agreed that Myanmar’s side can have 30pc shares. But the additional shares – the shift from 15pc – means that they should take on some of the financing responsibilities from CITIC proportionately.”
 
 The way he sees it, “Myanmar should take the same risk as us. We should have Myanmar partners who would be willing to take on the same risk with us. It’s business.”
 
 “There seems to be a misconception that we, CITIC, are being greedy to ask for 85pc, but it was originally and clearly written that Myanmar’s side only required. We have been fully responding to the requirements and conditions. It is not us who wanted to have more shares than we are allowed to have! So, this should be clearly clarified,” Mr Hua highlighted.
 
 “Typically, for a project finance deal like this, 30pc will be consisting of equity and 70pc will be debt. So, we are actually bearing the largest chunk of the financing responsibility,” he explained.
 
 Justifying the stake
 
 But how is it politically justifiable for a foreign state-owned company to own a majority stake in a deep-sea port in another country?
 
 We had no intention to have the majority share in the beginning. It had been requested by the Myanmar government because it is not only just about the shares, it is [about] the investment. - Yuan Shaobin, CITIC
 
 “Of course, we know that Myanmar – at its current stage and compared to its surrounding countries – has the potential for development. That is why we committed an investment during that period.
 
 “Another point to make is considering China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Myanmar is a critical point. If we invest here, we could request more support from the government to do more business,” Mr Yuan said, adding that the project is helpful for developing Myanmar’s economy.
 
 But since the transfer of political leadership and change in government, “nobody [from the Myanmar government] cared about this [Kyaukphyu project], thought about this or about how to deal with this,” according to CITIC.

499,The Myanmar Times,https://www.mmtimes.com/news/legal-questions-arise-over-kyaukphyu-ports-esia-process.html,0,,Myanmar,E,2019-07-19 00:00:00,Legal questions arise over Kyaukphyu port’s ESIA process,"State-owned enterprise CITIC, in charge of the proposed US$1.3 billion Kyaukphyu port, kick-started the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) and preliminary geological survey this month.
 
 
 
 
 
 The company said Canadian firm Hatch was hired as project manager to supervise the process and recruit the ESIA project consultants and contractors.
 
 On July 2, CITIC held the first stakeholder meetings at the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Management Committee office in Yangon, and made site visits to the Madae Island.
 
 It said it would “develop participation mechanisms for all stakeholders of the project in order to take extensive and adequate consultation” as part of the ESIA process. The preparation work will be carried out “in a rigorous, open and transparent manner.”
 
 The idea of building a port and an industrial park in Kyaukphyu was mooted by the U Thein Sein government in 2015, which greenlighted the consortium led by CITIC to come up with a plan to establish a $7.5 billion SEZ in central Rakhine. A corporate promotional video suggests the scheme will create an investment and logistics hub akin to Hong Kong and Singapore.
 
 
 
 
 
 The government last November signed a “framework agreement” with CITIC. Myanmar will own 30 percent of the stake and the project will cost $1.3 billion. European and Japanese investors are unlikely to set up shop in the port or the industrial park, Yangon-based sources said.
 
 However, confusion arises over the legal framework currently adopted by the developers. Myanmar’s environmental law demands a site-wide environmental impact assessment for a project of this size and scope, which should include an assessment of both environmental and social impacts.
 
 CITIC’s latest press statement suggests that its current ESIA process is specifically for the port and not an SEZ.
 
 If there’s to be an SEZ, that must be incorporated in the site-wise assessment, according to ICJ legal adviser Sean Bain. If the SEZ plan is scrapped and only a port project is planned, then it’s likely CITIC is operating under the wrong legal framework because the Investment Law would apply instead of the SEZ Law.
 
 “We’re hopeful that developers and authorities will make good on commitments to implement projects lawfully in a manner that addresses the human rights concerns documented by our organisation and others in Kyaukphyu.
 
 “Yet to date we haven’t seen signs of a change in approach: long overdue, genuine transparency on project plans would be a good start,” he told The Myanmar Times.
 
 There is another potential problem with the current approach, observers say. Kofi Annan’s Rakhine Advisory Commission recommended the Myanmar government to conduct a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) before the ESIA process, in order to explore its consequences on local communities and outline the risks and benefits to other industries in the area.
 
 State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi had publicly promised to implement all recommendations from the Commission.
 
 A WWF 2017 report also recommended Myanmar’s government to undertake an SEA for the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) to better assess and minimise the environmental risks.
 
 The report also stated that BRI road projects could damage Myanmar’s natural capital assets which are crucial to mitigating natural disaster risks.
 
 For example, Rakhine State is the region of Myanmar most threatened by natural disasters and by future impacts of climate change. An SEA would help to identify strategic adaptation and mitigation measures to preserve a healthy environment for all.
 
 “If Kyaukphyu is to be the megaproject initially envisaged, the government would be wise to commission a strategic environmental assessment for the whole area and its surrounds, as recommended by its own advisory commission more than two years ago,” Mr Bain added.
 
 The ESIA process suggests the government will not carry out the SEA. The government spokesperson did not respond to calls seeking comment.
 
 Rakhine State has been experiencing an internet blackout for nearly a month. The transport and communications ministry has directed all telecom operators on June 21 to temporarily cut off internet connectivity in nine townships of Rakhine and Chin states where fighting is taking place between the Tatmadaw (military) and armed groups, to ensure stability and rule of law.","['environmental', 'ports', 'esia', 'port', 'citic', 'sea', 'assessment', 'questions', 'kyaukphyu', 'legal', 'arise', 'process', 'sez', 'project', 'rakhine']","{'Hong Kong': 1, 'Japan': 1, 'Myanmar': 7, 'Singapore': 1, 'United States': 1}",,,,,

 YANGON—Amid increasing pressure from China to resume the controversial Myitsone Dam project, the State Counselor has promised that her government will make a final decision on the dam based upon political, economic and environmental considerations, and vowed to make public the details of the decision.
 
 When asked her opinion of the Myitsone Dam project at a meeting with local residents in Pyay, Bago Region on Thursday, State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said, “I would like you to think [about the project] from a wider perspective.”
 
 She said, “We should not think based on one perspective. If we think from only one perspective, we could make the wrong [decision].”
 
 The State Counselor said the final decision would have to be politically, socially, economically and environmentally sound and sustainable.
 
 Daw Aung San Suu Kyi did not offer her own stance on whether the dam project should be scrapped, nor did she say when a decision would be made.
 
 However, she said her government should not abolish projects approved by a previous government just because it did not comply with the current administration’s policies.
 
 If government of the day were to break promises made by previous governments, the country would lose credibility, she said.
 
 She added that her government would make decisions transparently, not only when it comes to the Myitsone project, but also on other projects.
 
 The proposed US$3.6-billion (approximately 5.48 trillion kyats) Myitsone Dam is one of seven hydropower projects planned for the upper reaches of the Irrawaddy River as well as the Mali and N’Mai rivers, at whose confluence the Irrawaddy begins. Work on the project started in 2009, but then-President Thein Sein suspended it in 2011 amid widespread public concern over the dam’s social and environmental impacts.
 
 Experts point out that the dam site is important for its biodiversity, and environmentalists warn the project would both destroy the natural beauty of the Irrawaddy River and disrupt water flow downstream.
 
 The project remains in limbo. After the National League for Democracy took power in 2016, the government set up a 20-member commission including the chief minister of Kachin to review the project, including its environmental and social impacts. The commission has produced two reports to date, but the government has yet to release either.
 
 Recently, Chinese officials strongly pressured Kachin political and religious leaders on the need to restart the Myitsone project, saying it was an important part of China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Initiative.
 
 In late January, Investment and Foreign Economic Relations Minister U Thaung Tun said at a press conference the government is working hard to come up with a final decision on how to proceed with the controversial Myitsone Dam project. The minister said the government and a commission studying the project are in very serious discussions and considering all possibilities, including downsizing the dam, relocating it or developing other projects instead.
 
 U Thaung Tun said the China-backed project is dogged by major problems and has received nationwide pushback. He said the dam project as it was initially conceived under the previous government was “misguided”.
 
 Many experts believe the Myanmar government needs to a make final decision on Myitsone before Daw Aung San Suu Kyi visits Beijing to attend a BRI forum in April. She is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the forum.","['wider', 'state', 'kyi', 'repeats', 'decision', 'perspective', 'dam', 'final', 'san', 'project', 'counselor', 'myitsone', 'suu']","{'China': 3, 'Mali': 2, 'Myanmar': 2, 'United States': 1}",,,,,
